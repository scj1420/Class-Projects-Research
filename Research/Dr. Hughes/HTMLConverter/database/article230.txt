   I am frequently asked to recommend statistics books to
   beginners, so I was very eager to see what was in this book.

   First the good. It is very well written, and covers the basics
   clearly and understandably to someone with only high school
   algebra — nothing more advanced is needed. And in addition to
   the basics, the author discusses p-hacking, misleading plots,
   and other important topics that are frequently left out of
   introductory texts.

   The examples are primarily from economics, as befits the book’s
   title. The book is not aimed at math students, so there are no
   proofs and no derivations. They can be found in other texts or
   in a further course. Also, the range of statistics covered is
   narrow, mostly about normal distributions and linear
   regression, but in my opinion suitable for such a first course.

   However nice, for me the book has one large flaw. I cannot
   understand why a stats book today would not have R code to
   demonstrate the various topics. The book has 50 or so exercises
   in each chapter, and many are repetitive. That space could have
   been used for simple R scripts, or they could have been put
   online (there are, as yet, no online resources for students).
   Without the derivations, without proofs, without code to
   illustrate what is going on, I think a huge opportunity has
   been wasted to help the student understand, rather than
   memorize.

   I do think the explanations are very clear, so perhaps the book
   could be further refined into a “Statistics for Managers” type
   book, but as a text for beginning students, for me, it falls
   short.
