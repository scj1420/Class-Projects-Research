   This is an interesting take on an introductory number theory
   course, one that is heavily slanted toward the prime numbers.
   As such, it omits or mentions only briefly many topics that
   would normally appear in an introductory course, such as
   Diophantine equations, partitions, and continued fractions. It
   squeezes in a little bit on irrational numbers and on quadratic
   reciprocity, but these are given as isolated results that don’t
   go anywhere.

   The book is chatty and leisurely, with lots of historical notes
   and lots of worked examples. The exercises at the end of each
   chapter are good and there are a reasonable number of them. The
   prerequisites are higher than usual for a book at this level:
   single and multiple variable calculus and linear algebra. The
   book develops all the complex analysis and abstract algebra it
   needs.

   The book is subtitled “An Introduction via the Density of
   Primes”, which is not really true because it does many other
   things too. It does have very good coverage of prime
   distribution, including proofs of Dirichlet’s theorem on primes
   in arithmetic progressions, Bertrand’s Postulate that between
   each number and its double is a prime, Newman’s simple analytic
   proof of the prime number theorem, a mostly-complete sketch of
   the Selberg–Erdös elementary proof of the prime number theorem,
   and Brun’s theorem that the sum of the reciprocals of the twin
   primes converges. There’s a lot on primality testing, including
   a description of the AKS polynomial-time algorithm. Most of the
   proofs are familiar ones; the innovation in the book is in the
   choice of topics rather than the approach.

   The emphasis on primes leads to some peculiarities, especially
   because of the exclusion of Diophantine equations. For example,
   there are lengthy chapters on algebraic numbers and on p-adic
   numbers that has almost no applications. There’s also a good
   development of elliptic curves, but they are used only for
   primality testing and proving and not for studying equations.

   Bottom line: a good text for an introductory course, if you
   have enough flexibility to omit many traditional topics.
