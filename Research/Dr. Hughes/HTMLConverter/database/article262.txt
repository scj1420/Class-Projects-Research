Problem

   You lead a scientific expedition to Siberia, where your team
   successfully obtains a sample of an ancient virus preserved in
   the permafrost. Ecstatic about the discovery, you and your team
   quickly head back to the lab to isolate the virus.

   After a long night's work, you successfully isolate the virus
   in a series of test tubes for study. You are the last person to
   leave the lab, and as you do, a sudden earthquake rocks the
   surrounding countryside. After the tremors cease, you hear an
   alarm that indicates the vials of the isolated virus have been
   shattered.

   The lab consists of 16 rooms in a 4x4 configuration. The
   entrance is at the top left, and the exit is at the bottom
   right. All of the rooms except for the entrance had test tubes
   of the virus in them, and they all shattered, contaminating the
   rooms. A noxious chemical gas is released in the rooms with
   broken test tubes, and in a short time, the lab will
   automatically vent the rooms out into the world, releasing a
   deadly plague.

   You spring into action and don your hazmat suit, ready to pull
   the emergency switches in each room, which will release a
   chemical slurry into the room and neutralize the deadly virus.
   But there is a problem. Once you enter a contaminated room, you
   must pull the emergency switch in order to open the exit. After
   you leave, the room locks down and you cannot reenter that
   room.

   How do you find a path through the lab that allows you to pull
   the emergency switch in every contaminated room before leaving
   the lab?
