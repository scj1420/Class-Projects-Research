   Fall Out of Line

   If you set up a row of dominoes on end with appropriate spacing
   between them (as shown from a bird’s-eye view in the diagram)
   and then push over the domino at one end (A), it will set off a
   chain reaction resulting in the domino at the other end (B)
   falling. Conversely, if you push B over, it will cause A to
   fall.

   How can you arrange dominoes, leaving A and B where they are,
   but possibly rearranging the others and/or adding more dominoes
   if needed, so that pushing A over will make B fall, but not
   vice versa?

   Watch for Falling Nuts

   Two squirrels knock acorns off a tree with identical horizontal
   velocity (and initially no vertical velocity, although the
   constant acceleration due to gravity quickly propels both
   acorns toward the ground, which happens to be perfectly level
   in the vicinity of this tree). The first squirrel knocks its
   acorn off from six meters above the ground. The other acorn
   lands twice as far away from the tree as the first one. Assume
   that air resistance has no effect on the motion of the acorns.

   From how high did the second squirrel knock off its acorn?

   For last week’s Hexadiagonal, the volume of either pyramid is
   1/3 the volume of the cube, and the five-sided solid
   inHexintersection has exactly 1/2 the volume of the
   tetrahedron.

   24 meters seems correct.   Distance that a falling object
   travels uses the formula  d=1/2 a t*2 where d is the distance
   traveled, a is the acceleration due to gravity and t is the
   time.    Since the velocities of the 2 acorns are the same, the
   further acorn must take twice the time to hit the ground in
   order to  travel double the distance.  In the above equation,
   for the first acorn, d equals 6.  In the second equation,  d is
   the unknown, and  the time can be represented as 2t, such that
   the equation becomes d=1/2 a 4t*2, and substituting 6 for the
   1/2 a t*2 gives d=24.   Note the * means exponent (t
   squared).

   I agree with John Fuller -   stacking extra dominoes behind A
   is how I approached the solution.

   The horizontal distance is linear in time, so the second acorn
   was in the air for twice as long. The vertical distance is
   quadratic in time, so it was 4x higher than the first acorn.

   For the domino problem, there are a bunch of solutions if we
   allow dominoes to be placed arbitrarily in 2 dimensions, rather
   than only on the line between A and B.

   I got 24 meters (inverse square law and formula for range of a
   projectile).

   As for the dominoes, the most obvious answer is to stack
   several extra dominoes flat right behind A so that it can't
   fall backwards. Probably not what the puzzle is asking for, but
   it is completely within the stated parameters.
