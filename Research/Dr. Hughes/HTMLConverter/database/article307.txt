Complicating Predictability

   Chaos, seasonality, and behavioral dynamics complicate
   modeling. Behavioral complexities include variable willingness
   to be vaccinated and self-imposed isolation upon becoming sick.
   Measles in the pre-vaccination era tended to be less
   complicated by such behavior. This behavior, as well as the
   relatively high incidence of measles, make pre-vaccination
   dynamics an especially good testbed for understanding the
   epidemic clockwork.

   In the pre-vaccination period, measles persisted for a long
   time in large cities because sufficient transmissions in many
   settings maintained a chain of transmission in interepidemic
   troughs. Epidemics faded out in populations below the critical
   community size of 250-300K. In contrast, as vaccinations reduce
   measles incidence, epidemics are becoming more irregular, with
   frequent local stochastic extinctions of infection. High levels
   of immunization above a ‘herd immunity’ threshold of 90-95% can
   interrupt measles transmission even in large populations (see
   Figure 2).

   Given moderate seasonality of transmission (as in the
   pre-vaccination United Kingdom data), measles dynamics in large
   cities corresponded quite well to a relatively predictable
   limit cycle. Seasonality in the U.K. and the U.S. was largely
   due to enhanced transmission when children aggregated in
   school. Typically, outbreaks were high before Christmas and low
   during the summer holidays.

   But nonlinear dynamics can interact with stronger seasonal
   forcing to create a more complex picture. For example, measles
   is still a major threat in Niamey, the capital of Niger, where
   highly seasonal transmission causes much higher amplitude
   forcing than in the U.K. This has the same effect as powerfully
   pushing a pendulum, and leads to much more irregular,
   apparently chaotic dynamics.

   Even a subtle increase in forcing can drive dynamic
   complexities. For instance, summer vacations are slightly
   longer in the U.S. than in the U.K, and these small increases
   drove remarkably irregular dynamics during the 1920s and 30s.
   While London saw biennial and annual cycles, Spokane and Los
   Angeles experienced three- and four-year cycles, as seen in
   Figure 3 [1].

   “Despite these complexities, we should always try to predict
   epidemics or understand the limits of predictability where we
   can’t,” Grenfell says. “There are great lessons to be learned
   from predictions made in weather forecasting, which is arguably
   a more complex system. At the population level, there is
   evidence for emerging simplicity in epidemiological dynamics.
   At reasonable scales, the SIR model works well, exposing the
   limits of predictability. Predict when you can, and understand
   that problems arise when reaching the limits.”

   Grenfell believes that in the future a much broader range of
   expertise will be used to clarify how dynamics of human
   behaviors, climate change, and pathogen evolution affect
   epidemic dynamics.
