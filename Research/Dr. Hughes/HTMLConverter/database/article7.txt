   The past year has delivered an array of STEM-related titles for
   younger readers. Our first gift guide for 2016 features books
   we think preschoolers through early-elementary schoolkids will
   thoroughly enjoy. (More on how we’ve categorized our gift
   guides for kids’ books below.)

   Here you’ll find three books about scientists named Ada, books
   about plants that move and animals that can be tricky to find,
   books about liquid water that flows through pipes and frozen
   water that serves as penguin habitat, and a book that includes
   two extremely loyal bulldogs.

   For the purpose of our gift guides, by the way, the age range
   for books we’ve categorized for younger readers tops out at
   around 8 years. We consult the publishers’ age-range
   guidelines, and many books fall on the borderlineâso if you’re
   seeking books for kids just under 8 years old, you might also
   take a look at our [26]gift guide for older children.


   [27]Ada Lovelace, Poet of Science: The First Computer
   Programmer. Written by Diane Stanley; illustrated by Jessie
   Hartland. Simon and Schuster, 2016. $17.99. Ages 4â8.


   This charmingly illustrated book begins Ada Lovelace’s
   biography when she was a little girl full of imagination and
   ideas for inventions. We follow Ada from her early musings,
   which met with her mother’s disapproval, to her teenage years,
   attending balls with the likes of inventor Charles Babbage and
   naturalist Charles Darwin, and then on to her married life,
   during which she works with Babbage in a friendly
   collaboration. Along the way, readers learn about the history
   of women and science in England in the 1800s. âKatie L. Burke

   [28]Ada’s Ideas: The Story of Ada Lovelace, the World’s First
   Computer Programmer. Fiona Robinson. Abrams, 2016. $17.95. Ages
   6â9.


   Fiona Robinson has created a drop-dead gorgeous world in Ada’s
   Ideas, with bright colors and crisp-edged, intricate paper
   cutouts and collages balanced by backgrounds ranging from graph
   paper to smoky watercolors to serene pastels. This approach
   works well for telling the story of a girl growing up in a
   complicated family situationâespecially one who has abilities
   and interests vast enough to thoroughly challenge conventional
   expectations of women at the time. Robinson’s approach is
   especially fruitful when she uses a mazelike collection of
   paper-cutout spirals to illustrate how Lovelace created an
   algorithm that could instruct a machine to calculate Bernoulli
   numbers, guiding the machine’s selections sequentially. The
   mathematical concept is complex but, following the instructions
   Robinson provides, children can trace a path along the
   multicolored paper trails to see just how Lovelace put the
   sequence together. âDianne Timblin

   Torn between Two Lovelaces

      As it happens, 2016 brought two terrific new kids’ books about
      19th-century mathematical wonder Ada Lovelace: Ada Lovelace,
      Poet of Science and Ada’s Ideas. To complicate matters for
      harried holiday shoppers trying to quickly distinguish between
      the two books, both cover hues happen to be pastel shades of
      blue, both titles begin with “Ada,” and both books are intended
      for kids under 10. Truth be told, kids may thoroughly enjoy
      reading both books, especially if they’re captivated by
      mathematics or history. As you might expect, though, the titles
      do cover much of the same territory: Lovelace’s childhood, how
      her passion for systems and numbers led to intriguing work as
      an adult, and the influence of her family on her life and work.
      (Her father, famously, was rakish poet Lord Byron. Her mother,
      a mathematician, fretted incessantly that her daughter would
      also lead a dissipated life.) Nonetheless, the books differ
      significantly in tone and details. Stanley’s Ada Lovelace is
      more whimsical even as it remains true to the science, and it's
      also a bit lighter and warmer. Robinson’s Ada’s Ideas does a
      great job of delving into more of the complexity of Lovelace’s
      work. These details are interesting in themselves, yet they
      also help convey the depth of Lovelace’s imagination, not just
      the height of its flight. If you must choose, the age of the
      child you have in mind may be key. Ada Lovelace is intended for
      slightly younger children (ages 4â8), while Ada’s Ideas was
      written for kids who are a little older (ages 6â9); so for
      preschoolers and kindergartners, I’d recommend the former, and
      for second graders and up, the latter. But, hm, what about
      first graders? Oh heck, just read ‘em both! âDianne Timblin

   [29]Ada Twist, Scientist. Written by Andrea Beatty; illustrated
   by David Roberts. Abrams, 2016. $17.95. Ages 5â7.


   [30]Rosie Revere, Engineer. Written by Andrea Beatty;
   illustrated by David Roberts. Abrams, 2013. $17.95. Ages 5â7.


   [31]Iggy Peck, Architect. Written by Andrea Beatty; illustrated
   by David Roberts. Abrams, 2007. $17.95. Ages 5â7.


   When my five-year-old daughter first saw these books, she
   practically pulled them from my hands, saying “Mom, I NEED
   these, to learn how to be a scientist!” These books may not
   teach her the scientific method exactly, but what they do
   emphasize is perseverance. Ada Twist often makes a mess with
   her experiments, and her family has to come to terms with that.
   Rosie Revere learns to overcome failure with her inventions
   before she succeeds. Iggy Peck takes the initiative to rescue
   himself and his friends with innovative materials use in
   building. These are great baseline principles to encourage kids
   to keep trying, even when they don’t get it right the first
   time. âFenella Saunders

   [32]Baby Loves Aerospace Engineering. Written by Ruth Spiro;
   illustrated by Irene Chan. Charlesbridge, 2016. $8.95. Ages
   0â3.


   [33]Baby Loves Quarks. Written by Ruth Spiro; illustrated by
   Irene Chan. Charlesbridge, 2016. $8.95. Ages 0â3.


   I applaud this series of board books for attempting to bring
   some complicated topics down to a very introductory level.
   Using cute and colorful illustrations, these books rely on the
   familiar to explain the unfamiliar. Baby Loves Quarks equates a
   tower built with toy blocks to atoms built with quarks; Baby
   Loves Aerospace Engineering shows how birds fly, using that as
   a way to explain what happens in aerodynamics. Obviously, the
   books have to keep things on a very abstract level, but if
   you’re looking for baby books that at least bring up the
   subjects of physics and engineering as normal aspects of
   everyday life, these are a great place to start. âFenella
   Saunders

   [34]Does a Fiddler Crab Fiddle? Written by Corinne Demas and
   Artemis Roehrig; illustrated by John Sandford. Persnickety
   Press, 2016. $15.95. Ages 4â8.


   This book is perfect for the toddler who loves to say “No!”
   (And what toddler doesn’t?) With each absurdist questionâsuch
   as, “Does a fiddler crab ride a skateboard?”âthe authors
   introduce a new fact about the fiddler crab’s natural history.
   Even adults will likely learn something new about this quirky
   crustacean. The illustrations are equally fun, inviting readers
   to consider fiddler crabs not only fiddling but also wearing
   sunglasses and doing magic tricks. âKatie L. Burke

   [35]Follow That Tap Water! A Journey Down the Drain. Written by
   Bridget Heos; illustrated by Alex Westgate. Amicus, 2016.
   $29.95. Ages 5 and up.


   Kids see water come out of the tap, and they generally don’t
   understand how it connects to rain or rivers. They also don’t
   understand why they can’t drink water from, say, a pond. This
   book provides them with an outline of the numerous steps water
   has to go through in order to be safe, and also what happens to
   water once it leaves the house again. It’s got enough
   kid-grabbing grossness to keep them interestedâmy five-year-old
   was howling at microbes eating toilet water. My kids also
   enjoyed the water-drop characters and their funny little
   catchphrases. (“Now I’m fat free!” exclaims a water drop as it
   exits a waste water treatment that removes fats and oils.) A
   suggested experiment at the end of the book gives kids a basic
   idea of how water filters work. It’s relatively quick and easy
   to set up, and kids end up feeling a strong sense of connection
   to the whole water cycle. âFenella Saunders

   [36]Grandmother Fish: A Child’s First Book of Evolution.
   Written by Jonathan Tweet, illustrated by Karen Lewis. Feiwel
   and Friends, 2016. $17.99. Ages 3â6.


   The concept of evolution can be difficult for young kids to
   grasp. You can’t really explain the intricacies of genetics on
   their level. And they don’t have a real sense of the time
   scales over which the Earth has existed. But this book provides
   a great way to start the conversation. It explains evolution by
   discussing how plants and animals pass along certain
   capabilities to their descendants (such as breathing air or
   walking on land), how those abilities connect living beings to
   their ancestors, and how the capabilities also add up over
   time. A guide at the end goes into more detail about these
   abilities and offers simple approaches you can take to explain
   basic evolutionary concepts to kids, such as descent with
   modification and natural and artificial selection. It also
   includes a list of common misconceptions about evolution,
   presented alongside accurate information that may help kids
   better understand the process. âFenella Saunders

   [37]The Marvelous Thing That Came from a Spring: The Accidental
   Invention of the Toy that Swept the Nation. Gilbert Ford.
   Atheneum, 2016. $17.99. Ages 4â8.


   With writing and artwork by Gilbert Ford, illustrator of the
   wonderful Mr. Ferris and His Wheel (included in our [38]2014
   gift guide recommendations), this story of the Slinky is full
   of diorama-style assemblages mixed with illustration and
   photography. It unfolds the tale of how inventions come
   aboutâserendipitous discovery followed by a lot of hard
   workâand the tension that can result when market forces stand
   in the way of a good idea. The language is a bit hyperbolic,
   and although it’s great that the inventor’s wife is given
   prominent credit for her part in the Slinky’s invention and
   marketing, traditional gender roles still seem to be reinforced
   (perhaps unavoidable given the era when the invention took
   place). Nevertheless, kids will likely enjoy learning the back
   story of a toy that is still one of their favorites.
   âFenella Saunders


   [39]One Day on Our Blue Planet . . . in the Antarctic. by Ella
   Bailey. Flying Eye, 2016. $16.95. Ages 3â7.


   Illustrator Ella Bailey’s sweet and lively introduction to the
   creatures that inhabit the wild and remote Antarctic is filled
   with a surprising variety of species. This is the second title
   in her series of books that depict a day in the life of a baby
   animal in the wild. Kids will have fun following the AdÃ©lie
   penguin chick’s adventures in the Antarctic Ocean. Bailey’s
   friendly illustrationsâin soft blues, aquas, and purples with
   complimentary accents of pink and orangeâdepict the environment
   the AdÃ©lie penguin chick shares with other creatures, big and
   small, as well as the dangers and wonders she encounters in the
   sea and under the ice.âBarbara Aulicino

   [40]Plants Can’t Sit Still. Written by Rebecca Hirsch,
   illustrated by Mia Posada. Millbrook, 2016. $14.99. Ages 5â10.


   This wonderful book teaches about all the ways that plants
   moveâfrom various modes of seed dispersal to subtle movements,
   such as growing taller or closing up flowers at night. It
   encourages children to look at plants in a new way and pay
   attention to all the details that tell us about how plants move
   and transport themselves. Indeed, plants fly, swim, hide, eat
   bugs, ride inside bears, and more! A section at the end
   includes detailed descriptions of each plant depicted in the
   book, explaining more about its natural history and how and why
   it moves. The watercolor illustrations show plenty of plant
   action to help readers know what to look for in their parks,
   backyards, and gardens.

   [41]The Animal Cell. Thomai Dion. [42]Think-a-Lot Tots series.
   CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2016. $9.99. Up to
   age 6.


   [43]How Many Microorganisms? Thomai Dion. [44]Think-a-Lot Tots
   series. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2016.
   $9.99. Up to age 6.


   [45]The Neuron. Thomai Dion. [46]Think-a-Lot Tots series.
   CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2016. $9.99. Up to
   age 6.


   [47]My Science Lab Notebook. Thomai Dion. [48]Think-a-Lot Tots
   series. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2016.
   $7.99. Ages 3 and up.


   Although these books indicate that they’re intended for
   toddlers, my five-year-old found them more engaging than my
   three-year-old. My five-year-old’s favorite in the series was
   The Neuron, and after reading about the brain’s helper cells
   (as they are called in the book), she ran around giggling and
   saying, “My brain is sending messages to my body to walk! My
   brain is sending messages to my mouth to smile!”

   The Animal Cell was a good place to start, as it describes all
   the pieces inside a cellâhandy background information for other
   topics in the series. How Many Microorganisms? was visually
   engaging as it described the many different shapes that
   microorganisms can take. However, some of the language in this
   book landed a bit above my kids’ heads and required additional
   explanation. Finally My Science Lab Notebook is aimed at older
   children who can already read and write, but it includes space
   that younger children can use to draw pictures of experiments.
   (If your kids watch TV shows such as Sid the Science Kid, where
   he has a lab notebook in which to draw experiment results, they
   will particularly enjoy having a notebook of their own.) For
   instance, one of my five-year-old’s recent experiments involved
   rubbing a plastic comb over different surfaces to hear the
   various sounds produced; then she tried to figure out why those
   sounds were different from each other. She enjoyed being able
   to write (or draw) the results for herself. âFenella Saunders

   [49]Tiny Creatures: The World of Microbes. Written by Nicola
   Davies; illustrated by Emily Sutton. Candlewick, 2014. $15.99.
   Ages 5â8.


   Although the images of animals in this book aren’t drawn
   entirely to scale, Tiny Creatures does a great job of getting
   across just how small microbes areâpointing out, for example,
   that an ant antenna would have to be as big as a blue whale for
   the millions of bacteria on it to be visible to humans. The
   numbers of microbes in a drop of water or a spoon of soil are
   equated with the human populations of New York state or India,
   respectively. Also, a series of illustrations demonstrates the
   speed at which microbes can replicate, much to the amazement of
   my five-year-old. âFenella Saunders

   [50]A Voyage in the Clouds: The (Mostly) True Story of the
   First International Flight by Balloon in 1785. Written by
   Matthew Olshan; illustrated by Sophie Blackall. Farrar, Straus,
   and Giroux, 2016. $17.99. Ages 4â8.


   I’d like to play coy about this book, really I would. But I’ll
   give it to you straight: This is one of the most delightful
   books I’ve read all year. Olshan spins the tale (mostly true,
   as the title frames it) of the first balloon flight to
   successfully ferry people across the English Channel. The two
   adventurers so ferried were Jean-Pierre Blanchard, the pilot,
   and John Jeffries, a doctor and the venture’s financier. The
   year is 1782, and the men are at odds from the beginning. Their
   hilariously awkward conflicts leaven the story, which pits
   Englishman versus Frenchman, speechifier versus doer, type A
   personality versus type B. The characters and their conflicts
   are mirrored by each man’s canine mini-me: Jeffries brings
   along an English bulldog; Blanchard’s bulldog is, of course,
   French. Eventually, a crisis reshapes the relationship as the
   men put their heads together to get past a very sticky
   aeronautic wicket. Olshan’s lively narration illuminates a
   milestone in the history of flight while also conveying a bit
   of the physics involved in ballooning. Sophie Blackall’s clever
   illustrations, presented as stylized riffs on 18th-century
   illustrations, heighten the pleasure of the book and etch its
   scenes all the more deeply into memory. âDianne Timblin

   [51]Where Did They Go? Emily Bornoff. Big Picture Press, 2016.
   $14.99. Ages 2â5.


   Do you feel there are too many brown bears and very hungry
   caterpillars in children’s books, and not enough addaxes,
   gharials, and bilbies? If so, this interactive book will make a
   fine addition to the book collection of a child close to your
   heart. Each spread depicts a new landscape on which the reader
   must find a hidden animal. The 13 animals introduced are some
   of the most elusive in the worldâthey are difficult to find
   even for a biologistâand each comes from a different part of
   the globe. âKatie L. Burke
