The Best of TWiME 2016

   Starting January 1, 2016, I tracked the most-shared stories
   each day in my [6]math ed Twitter list and assembled them as
   part of a weekly series called "This Week in Math Ed." This
   puts me in a pretty good position to review 2016. Instead of
   judging posts by what was most shared on the list, as I did
   each week, this time I'm using my own judgment and giving you
   the posts, stories, articles, resources, etc. that I liked the
   most. There's no way I could limit myself to ten (and no reason
   to), so I've listed 30 below. If you want to review all the
   year's TWiME posts for yourself, here's a handy table to find
   them all:


                Jan [7]8  [8]15  [9]22  [10]29

   Here's what I found to be the best of Math Ed Said:
   [59][nowak2014nctm2.jpg]
   Kate Nowak
   January 4: "[60]f(t): In Defense of Unsexy" by [61]Kate Nowak.
   Kate said it's all well and good for people to share their
   one-of-a-kind curricular masterpieces, but the world needs
   high-quality, everyday practice in their math curriculum, too.
   January 5: "[62]My Criteria for Fact-Based Apps" by [63]Tracy
   Johnston Zager. I applauded this post a year ago for how it
   articulated criteria for the choice and use of curricular
   materials, and I'm happy to applaud it again.
   February 1: "[64]Many parents hated Common Core math at first,
   before figuring it out" by Jay Mathews. I don't know if this
   article got much attention, but Jay Mathews has a long history
   writing about math reform and much of it hadn't been this
   positive.
   February 4: "[65]Why I am not quitting teaching" by [66]Anne
   Schwartz. It's not uncommon for teacher-bloggers to announce
   that their leadership abilities have led them out of the
   classroom. Anne wanted to push back and made sure the world
   knew that she was staying right where she was.
   February 9: "[67]A Group of American Teens Are Excelling at
   Advanced Math" by [68]Peg Tyre. This article in The Atlantic
   did a great job highlighting math clubs and competitions, and
   the opportunities they create for students looking to push
   themselves.
   February 21: "[69]Purposeful Numberless Word Problems" by
   [70]Brian Bushart. There have been some other posts about
   numberless word problems, but this one sticks out to me for its
   application of problem types identified in Cognitively Guided
   Instruction (CGI).
   February 27: "[71]The Wrong Way to Teach Math" by Andrew
   Hacker. Hacker's Math Myth drove a lot of conversations this
   year and I chose this op-ed out of many articles and blog posts
   to represent those conversations. Hacker rubbed some math
   educators the wrong way, but did so while rubbing an itch that
   apparently needed to be scratched.
   [72][horn2016innov8.jpg]
   Ilana Horn
   March 7: "[73]Professional Development is Broken, but Be
   Careful How We Fix It" by [74]Ilana Horn. In discussing the
   influence of local context on problems of practice, I love this
   observation from Lani: "In teaching, we see repeatedly that
   terms acquire the meaning of their setting more often than they
   bring new meanings to these places."
   March 13: "[75]On Purpose" by [76]Karim Kai Ani. Karim answered
   his question, "What is the purpose of math education, and what
   does it mean for the experience to be complete?"
   March 15: "[77]Teaching to the Test" by [78]Joe Schwartz. Joe
   had a number of well-shared posts in 2016, but I liked this one
   for the way it drew quality connections between instructional
   tasks and assessment tasks.
   April 12: "[79]Quarter the Cross" by [80]David Butler. This was
   my favorite account of one person's mathematical exploration in
   2016.
   April 30: "[81]The Search for Common-Core Curricula: Where Are
   Teachers Finding Materials?" by [82]Liana Heitin. This Ed Week
   article summarizes some findings from a RAND Corporation study
   that found that teachers are using things from all over the
   place — and using a lot of materials they've developed
   themselves — in an attempt to align their curriculum to the
   Common Core.
   [83][rj_20150416_110508_049_export1200.jpg]
   Geoff Krall
   May 5: "[84]A presentation format for deeper student
   questioning and universal engagement" by [85]Geoff Krall. Geoff
   described a nice routine for improving the quality of class
   presentations.
   May 13: "[86]Straight but Wiggled" by [87]Tracy Johnston Zager.
   I'm not sure I really felt the impact of "Which One Doesn't
   Belong" until I read this post.
   May 25: "[88]First Grade Fraction Talks... What?" by [89]Jamie
   Duncan. Jamie has a wonderful ability to tell the story of a
   lesson and illustrate it with student actions and artifacts.
   June 7: "[90]Lessons for Other People" by [91]Chris Lusto.
   Chris's post was a good conversation-starter as lots of people
   have things to say about using curriculum materials from
   someone else versus things they've built for themselves. This
   was one of the things that triggered [92]my series on lesson
   planning and sharing.
   [93][rj_20161116_191214_084_export1200.jpg]
   Matt Larson
   June 17: "[94]The Vision Thing" by [95]Matt Larson. NCTM's new
   president regularly wrote good things this year, but I thought
   this post about his vision for NCTM stood out.
   July 1: "[96]Concept vs Procedure: An anecdote about what it
   means to be good at math" by [97]Mark Chubb. Mark's post
   highlighted the understanding some students can demonstrate
   when we give them opportunities to look at non-routine
   problems.
   July 22: "[98]#ExpandMTBoS" by [99]Sam Shah. Sam isn't just
   interested in getting more people involved. Here he got
   specific about the kinds of projects he'd like to see started
   and shared in the community.
   July 31: "[100]Habits of highly mathematical people" by
   [101]Jeremy Kun. There are very real debates about the ability
   of knowledge to transfer from one situation to the next, but I
   basically agreed with Jeremy that enough time and experience
   doing mathematics (and being immersed in the culture of
   mathematics) can shape a person's skills and perspectives in
   math-oriented ways.
   August 13: "[102]This Is Why There Are So Many Ties In
   Swimming" by [103]Timothy Burke. This Deadspin story came along
   with the Summer Olympics and was a nice example of attending to
   precision.
   August 15: "[104]#ObserveMe" by [105]Robert Kaplinsky. I'm
   impressed by the staying power of the #ObserveMe idea, as just
   this morning I saw a math teacher post a picture of the
   giving us a concrete way to help make teaching more of a
   public, professional act.
   August 28: "[106]Why Black Men Quit Teaching" by
   [107]Christopher Emdin. Emdin's post discussed the need to
   address systemic issues of race and power in education along
   with creating a more diverse teacher workforce.
   September 11: "[108]How to sabotage your classroom culture in 5
   seconds" by [109]Ilona Vashchyshyn. Ilona admirably admitted a
   classroom moment gone wrong, and the steps she'd take to
   prevent and repair fragile relationships with students and
   mathematics.
   [110][rj_20160411_103205_239_export1200.jpg]
   Dan Meyer
   September 15: "[111]The Desmos Guide to Building Great
   (Digital) Math Activities" by [112]Dan Meyer. Dan gets a lot of
   airtime on TWiME because of his large following, and of all the
   posts I saw this year I chose this one as my favorite. Again, I
   like it when people articulate their criteria for quality
   classroom materials.
   October 2: "[113]Discovery" by [114]Dylan Kane. Dylan
   interrogated the "discovery" side of the false "discovery vs.
   direct instruction" side of the dichotomy and found several
   reasons for using discovery approaches sparingly.
   October 8: "[115]Meet the New Math, Unlike the Old Math by
   [116]Kevin Hartnett. This was the first in a well-written
   Quanta Magazine series about teaching math and science.
   [117][rj_20161117_093523_142_export1200.jpg]
   Fawn Nguyen
   October 28: "[118]Good-Enough-for-Now Curriculum" by [119]Fawn
   Nguyen. Again on my favorite theme of articulating criteria for
   quality, Fawn helped us understand what curricular resources
   she uses and when she decides to use them.
   December 8: "[120]The Progression of Fractions" by [121]Graham
   Fletcher. I could have chosen any of Graham's "Progression"
   video series, but I chose the most recent one for sharing here.
   They're all worth checking out.
   December 28: "[122]Exploring Fraction Constructs and
   Proportional Reasoning" by [123]Kyle Pearce. I appreciate this
   post by Kyle for the obvious effort that went into the ideas
   and the illustrations. The community benefits from posts like
   this.
