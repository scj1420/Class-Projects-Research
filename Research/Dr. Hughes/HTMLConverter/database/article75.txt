   Probabilities deserve their own unit! I propose Bayes, as in
   the probability that this proposal will gain traction is 0.001
   Bayes.

            sorry. Probability is unitless. It's better this way.
            Just a real number between 0 and 1.

            Not a quantum physicist but aren't imaginary/complex
            probabilities a thing?

            The problem is probability of probability, which
            should be Bayes² but is actually just Bayes, which is
            proof it's not a unit.

       Only a Bayesian would suggest that. But then evidently you
       are not since you didn't say "my prior". :-)

       doesn't it already have units? It called percent. The
       probability is 0.0001 % the new units will catch on.

       This is better done with self-information as prob can get
       too small. So 0.0002 event is 12 bits surprisal. Also
