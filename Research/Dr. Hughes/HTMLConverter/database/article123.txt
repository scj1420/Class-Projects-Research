4. ‘Go ahead; Stretch out and try new things.’

   I’m the type of person who is always excited to learn new
   things or apply what I know to new problems. However, as a pure
   mathematician leaving graduate school, I found it difficult to
   expand from my core expertise. At a national lab, I am
   constantly encouraged to approach new challenges. Some are
   close to my expertise, and some are a little farther. Either
   way this freedom lets me push my work into different and
   exciting directions.
