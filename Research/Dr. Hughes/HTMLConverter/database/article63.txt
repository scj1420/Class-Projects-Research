   Researchers have developed a mathematical formula based on the
   rhythmic movement of a sperm's head and tail, which
   significantly reduces the complexities of understanding and
   predicting how sperm make the difficult journey towards
   fertilising an egg.

   Researchers at the Universities of York, Birmingham, Oxford and
   Kyoto University, Japan, found that the sperm's tail creates a
   characteristic rhythm that pushes the sperm forward, but also
   pulls the head backwards and sideways in a coordinated fashion.

   Successful fertility relies on how a sperm moves through fluid,
   but capturing details of this movement is a complicated issue.

   The team aim to use these new findings to understand how larger
   groups of sperm behave and interact, a task that would be
   impossible using modern observational techniques. The work
   could provide new insights into treating male infertility.

   Dr Hermes Gadêlha, from the University of York's Department of
   Mathematics, said: "In order to observe, at the microscale, how
   a sperm achieves forward propulsion through fluid,
   sophisticated microscopic high precision techniques are
   currently employed.

   "Measurements of the beat of the sperm's tail are fed into a
   computer model, which then helps to understand the fluid flow
   patterns that result from this movement.

   "Numerical simulations are used to identify the flow around the
   sperm, but as the structures of the fluid are so complex, the
   data is particularly challenging to understand and use. Around
   55 million spermatozoa are found in a given sample, so it is
   understandably very difficult to model how they move
   simultaneously.

   "We wanted to create a mathematical formula that would simplify
   how we address this problem and make it easier to predict how
   large numbers of sperm swim. This would help us understand why
   some sperm succeed and others fail."

   By analysing the head and tail movements of the sperm,
   researchers have now shown that the sperm moves the fluid in a
   coordinated rhythmic way, which can be captured to form a
   relatively simple mathematical formula. This means complex and
   expensive computer simulations are no longer needed to
   understand how the fluid moves as the sperm swim.

   The research demonstrated that the sperm has to make multiple
   contradictory movements, such as moving backwards, in order to
   propel it forward towards the egg.

   The whip-like tail of the sperm has a particular rhythm that
   pulls the head backwards and sideways to create a jerky fluid
   flow, countering some of the intense friction that is created
   due to their diminutive sizes.

   Dr Gadêlha said: "It is true when scientists say how miraculous
   it is that a sperm ever reaches an egg, but the human body has
   a very sophisticated system of making sure the right cells come
   together.

   "You would assume that the jerky movements of the sperm would
   have a very random impact on the fluid flow around it, making
   it even more difficult for competing sperm cells to navigate
   through it, but in fact you see well defined patterns forming
   in the fluid around the sperm.

   "This suggests that sperm stirs the fluid around in a very
   coordinated way to achieve locomotion, not too dissimilar to
   the way in which magnetic fields are formed around magnets. So
   although the fluid drag makes it very difficult for the sperm
   to make forward motion, it does coordinate with its rhythmic
   movements to ensure that only a few selected ones achieve
   forward propulsion."

   Now that the team has a mathematical formula that can predict
   the fluid movement of one sperm, the next step is to use the
   model for predictions on larger numbers of cells. They also
   believe that it will have implications for new innovations in
   infertility treatment.

   The research is published in the journal Physical Review
   Letters.
