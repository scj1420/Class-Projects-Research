   This year's [17]Abel Prize has been awarded to Yves Meyer for
   the development of an incredibly powerful mathematical tool:
   wavelet theory. The theory enables you to break all sorts of
   different types of information into simpler components which
   are easier to analyse, process and store — which is why it
   finds applications in a huge range of areas, from medical
   imaging to the detection of gravitational waves.


   The inspiration for Meyer's work came, not from within
   mathematics, but from the oil industry. In the 1980s the French
   engineer [18]Jean Morlet wondered how to best use seismic data
   to find oil: if you send vibrations into the ground, how can
   you use their echo to figure out where the oil is hiding?
   Morlet, together with the physicist [19]Alex Grossmann, came up
   with a way of analysing the signals, and also coined the term
   "wavelet", but the oil industry wasn't interested. Morlet's
   method wasn't used, but it was published in a scientific
   journal.
   Sine wave


   This is a sine wave. It extends indefinitely to the left and
   right. Since sine waves are related to cosine, this could also
   be seen as a representation of a cosine wave.

   Meyer came across Morlet's results and spotted their potential.
   Mathematicians and engineers already had a powerful tool for
   analysing and processing certain types of information. Fourier
   analysis, as it's called, is best explained using sound as an
   example. The sound of the middle A on a tuning fork is
   represented by a perfect sine wave, such as the one seen on the
   left. Other sounds, like that of a violin playing the same
   note, are more complicated. However, it turns out that any
   periodic sound, in fact any type of periodic signal, can be
   decomposed into a sum of sine and cosine waves of different
   frequencies. This enables you to do a whole range of things.
   For example, it enables you to manipulate the different
   frequencies of a sound individually, or to "clean it up" by
   removing interfering noise. (You can read more about
   [20]Fourier analysis on Plus.)

   The function f varies in time – representing a sound wave. The
   Fourier transform process takes f and decomposes it into its
   constituent sine waves, with particular frequencies and
   amplitudes. The Fourier transform is represented as spikes in
   the frequency domain, the height of the spike showing the
   amplitude of the wave of that frequency.

   Fourier analysis is a versatile tool. It can also be used to
   analyse and process images and other types of information.
   However, it does come with a limitation: because the basic
   components — the sine and cosine waves — are periodic, Fourier
   analysis works best for repeating signals. It's not so good on
   non-periodic signals, which contain blips and spikes and all
   sorts of other irregular features. An endlessly undulating wave
   is no good at localising a unique feature such as a spike.
   Unfortunately for Fourier analysis, most real-life phenomena,
   from the sound of speech to seismic data, fall in the
   non-periodic category.

   This is waveform comes from human speech. It has regularities,
   but it's not periodic.

   This is where wavelet theory comes in. The idea is to start,
   not with a sine or cosine wave that's defined over all of the
   infinite number line, but with a piece of an oscillating
   function defined over just an interval. That's the mother
   wavelet. You can then form daughter wavelets by squashing the
   mother wavelet to a smaller interval (thereby increasing its
   frequency), expanding it over a larger interval (thereby
   reducing its frequency), or just shifting it along. A signal,
   such as the sound of human speech, is then expressed as a
   combination of such a system of wavelets. Such a decomposition
   enables you to capture repeating information in the signal, but
   it also allows you to zoom in on local irregularities, such as
   spikes, using a sequence of increasingly contracted versions of
   the mother wavelet.

   This is an example of two versions of a wavelet. A squashed
   version of the wavelet (above) has a higher frequency than the
   original version (below).

   To store such a decomposition of a signal you only need the
   information describing the original mother wavelet, as well as
   the contributions of the various daughter wavelets: these are
   enough to put the original signal back together again. This
   makes wavelets a particularly useful tool for compression of
   information. The FBI, for example, uses wavelets to store
   information of fingerprints which, due to their high level of
   detail, would otherwise take up a huge amount of storage space.

   The origins of wavelet theory go quite a long way back. The
   mathematician [21]Alfréd Haar already discovered a version of a
   wavelet over a hundred years ago. But it was Meyer who gave the
   theory solid mathematical foundations. He came up with families
   of wavelets that exhibit the mathematical properties that are
   necessary for the processing and analysis of signals and
   developed the general mathematical framework of the theory.


   [22]Stéphane Mallat, who collaborated with Meyer on wavelet
   theory, calls him a "visionary" whose work doesn't belong to
   any one area such as pure maths, applied maths, or computer
   science — it can only be labelled "amazing". Apart from the
   prestige of the Abel Prize, awarded since 2003 to recognise
   "contributions of extraordinary depth and influence to the
   mathematical sciences", Meyer can now enjoy the 765,000 Euros
   that come as prize money.
