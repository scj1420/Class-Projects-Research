   Summary:
          Scientists have developed a mathematical law to explain
          the size distribution of earthquakes, even in the cases
          of large-scale earthquakes such as those which occurred
          in Sumatra (2004) and in Japan (2011).

   As part of the "Research in Collaborative Mathematics" project
   run by the Obra Social "la Caixa," researchers of the
   Mathematics Research Centre (CRM) and the UAB have developed a
   mathematical law to explain the size distribution of
   earthquakes, even in the cases of large-scale earthquakes such
   as those which occurred in Sumatra (2004) and in Japan (2011).

   The probability of an earthquake occurring exponentially
   decreases as its magnitude value increases. Fortunately, mild
   earthquakes are more probable than devastatingly large ones.
   This relation between probability and earthquake magnitude
   follows a mathematical curve called the Gutenberg-Richter law,
   and helps seismologists predict the probabilities of an
   earthquake of a specific magnitude occurring in some part of
   the planet.

   The law however lacks the necessary tools to describe extreme
   situations. For example, although the probability of an
   earthquake being of the magnitude of 12 is zero, since
   technically this would imply the earth breaking in half, the
   mathematics of the Gutenberg-Richter law do not consider
   impossible a 14-magnitude earthquake.

   "The limitations of the law are determined by the fact that the
   Earth is finite, and the law describes ideal systems, in a
   planet with an infinite surface," explains Isabel Serra, first
   author of the article, researcher at CRM and affiliate lecturer
   of the UAB Department of Mathematics.

   To overcome these shortages, researchers studied a small
   modification in the Gutenberg-Richter law, a term which
   modified the curve precisely in the area in which probabilities
   were the smallest. "This modification has important practical
   effects when estimating the risks or evaluating possible
   economic losses. Preparing for a catastrophe where the losses
   could be, in the worst of the cases, very high in value, is not
   the same as not being able to calculate an estimated maximum
   value," clarifies co-author Álvaro Corral, researcher at the
   Mathematics Research Centre and the UAB Department of
   Mathematics.

   Obtaining the mathematical curve which best fits the registered
   data on earthquakes is not an easy task when dealing with large
   tremors. From 1950 to 2003 there were only seven earthquakes
   measuring higher than 8.5 on the Richter scale and since 2004
   there have only been six. Although we are now in a more active
   period following the Sumatra earthquake, there are very few
   cases and that makes it statistically a poorer period. Thus,
   the mathematical treatment of the problem becomes much more
   complex than when there is an abundance of data. For Corral,
   "this is where the role of mathematics is fundamental to
   complement the research of seismologists and guarantee the
   accuracy of the studies." According to the researcher, the
   approach currently used to analyse seismic risk is not fully
   correct and, in fact, there are many risk maps which are
   downright incorrect, "which is what happened with the Tohoku
   earthquake of 2011, where the area contained an
   under-dimensioned risk." "Our approach has corrected some
   things, but we are still far from being able to give correct
   results in specific regions," Corral continues.

   The mathematical expression of the law at the seismic moment,
   proposed by Serra and Corral, meets all the conditions needed
   to determine both the probability of smaller earthquakes and of
   large ones, by adjusting itself to the most recent and extreme
   cases of Tohoku, in Japan (2011) and Sumatra, in Indonesia
   (2004); as well as to determine negligible probabilities for
   earthquakes of disproportionate magnitudes.

   The derived Gutenberg-Richter law has also been used to begin
   to explore its applications in the financial world. Isabel
   Serra worked in this field before beginning to study
   earthquakes mathematically. "The risk assessment of a firm's
   economic losses is a subject insurance companies take very
   seriously, and the behaviour is similar: the probability of
   suffering losses decreases in accordance with the increase in
   volume of losses, according to a law that is similar to that of
   Gutenberg-Richter, but there are limit values which these laws
   do not take into consideration, since no matter how big the
   amount, the probability of losses of that amount never results
   in zero" Serra explains. "That makes the 'expected value of
   losses' enormous. To solve this, changes would have to be made
   to the law similar to those we introduced to the law on
   earthquakes."
