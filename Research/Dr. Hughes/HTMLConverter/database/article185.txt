       How about an easier problem? Can there be a n-variable
       polynomial that is positive and surjective, sending R^n
       onto (0,\infty)? Someone posted this on a board a couple
       weeks ago, and an answer was quickly provided. Note
       Motzkin’s has p(1,1)=0.

       It is a sum of squares, but you have to use rational
       functions instead of polynomials. In that case, the
       converse is true. This is Hilbert’s 17th problem, which was
       solved by Artin in 1927

       @Aaron perhaps you could demonstrate these rational
       functions using sympy? I have a hard time “visualizing”
       this.

       As far as I know, SymPy doesn’t have any algorithms for
       computing this. I’m not even sure what the sum of squares
       form of Motzkin’s polynomial is.
       The way to think of this is that for real polynomials,
       there is only one inequality, x^2 >= 0. All other
       inequalities are reducible to this form (subtract
       everything to the greater than side, rewrite the expression
       as a sum of squares).
       See for instance
       tive-polynomials/, which shows some famous inequalities
       (AM-GM and Cauchy-Shwarz) in this way.
