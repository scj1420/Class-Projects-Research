   An old adage holds that the flap of a butterfly's wing in
   Brazil can trigger a tornado in Texas weeks later. Though chaos
   theory says it's basically impossible to compute exactly how
   that might happen, scientists have made advances in applying
   math to predict the phenomenon behind it called turbulence.

   Recent progress by physicists from the Georgia Institute of
   Technology could one day help sharpen weather forecasts and
   extend their range by making better use of masses of weather
   and climate data.

   Turbulence can curve as a puff of air, swirl past a river bend
   or churn as a hurricane, and though its curlicues may appear
   random, turbulence lays down signature patterns that the
   physicists are investigating. They have developed a simple
   mathematical model that has helped them show how turbulent
   flows will evolve over intervals.

   And, in a novel experiment, they verified their predictions
   physically in a two-dimensional turbulent flow produced in a
   lab.

   'Butterfly Effect' catchphrase

   The new Georgia Tech research befits the origins of that adage.

   It was coined more than 55 years ago by MIT meteorology
   professor Edward Lorenz after he established that tiny forces
   influenced major weather enough to throw long-range forecasts
   for a loop. The title of his paper, "Predictability: Does the
   Flap of a Butterfly's Wing in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in
   Texas?" morphed into the well-known catchphrase.

   Michael Schatz and Roman Grigoriev, professors in Georgia
   Tech's School of Physics, along with graduate researchers
   Balachandra Suri and Jeffrey Tithof, published their research
   results online in the journal Physical Review Letters on
   Wednesday March 15, 2017. The research was funded by the
   National Science Foundation.

   Order in chaos

   For hundreds of years, while scientists used math to get a grip
   on Newton's falling apple, substantiate the Theory of
   Relativity and theorize the existence of the Higgs boson,
   turbulence has been like wet soap in math's grasp. But for all
   its elusiveness, turbulence impresses with visibly coherent,
   recurring, recognizable shapes.

   Fluid swirls quickly establish themselves then shift or
   disappear, but they reappear persistently at different
   locations, producing transient and varying, yet repeating
   patterns.

   "People have seen these patterns in turbulent flows for
   centuries, but we're finding ways to relate the patterns to
   mathematical equations describing fluid flows," Grigoriev said.
   Some recurrent patterns, in particular, interest Grigoriev and
   Schatz. They're called exact coherent structures (ECSs).

   They give the physicists convenient entry points into computing
   predictions about what turbulence will do next.

   Turbulent flow snapshots

   But what are these exact coherent structures? Visually, in
   turbulence, they may show up as fleeting moments when the
   patterns stop changing. And it can look like the flow is
   temporarily slowing down.

   To the untrained eye, an ECS doesn't look much different from
   the rest of the swirls and curls, but one can learn to spot
   them. "That's exactly how we go about finding them," Schatz
   said. "We watch the turbulence, continually taking snapshots.
   The flow is moving around, moving around. We look for the
   instant when it slows down the most, and we pick out a
   snapshot."

   "We feed that into the mathematical model," Schatz said, "and
   it indicates that we're close, and shows what the math looks
   like at that point." That math solution describes a point in
   the turbulent flow that can be worked with to compute a
   prediction of what the turbulence will do next.

   To understand what an exact coherent structure is dynamically,
   we need to step back from what turbulence looks like visually
   with bunches of curls and swirls. Instead, let's look at a
   turbulent flow as a single physical entity by translating it
   into a crude metaphor, a swinging pendulum -- with some marked
   oddities.

   Pendulum on its head

   This is going to get a bit abstract: First, invert the
   pendulum.

   Instead of picturing the bottom point of a normal pendulum's
   swing, the equilibrium, as a stable point in a stable swing,
   now, with the upside-down pendulum, the equilibrium is the
   top-most point. And it's unstable. Also, it doesn't swing in
   just two directions but in all directions.

   A turbulent flow's reliable patterns reflect dynamics that are
   back-and-forth-to-and-fro but in all kinds of variations.

   As the metaphorical pendulum swings up toward its peak, it
   comes to a near but never complete stop. Instead it flops over
   to some other side. That near-halt point is analogous to an
   exact coherent structure, but there are a few more kinks in the
   metaphor.

   "If we change initial dynamics ever so slightly, an inverted
   pendulum can swing past its unstable equilibrium at the peak,
   or it can stop and then start moving in the opposite direction.
   In the same way, the turbulent flow can evolve in various
   different ways after passing by an ECS," Grigoriev said.

   Multiple exact coherent structures with varying qualities turn
   up in a turbulent flow.

   Turbulence roads to ECS cities

   That all may feel unusual for a reason.

   "Usually, people like to look at stable things that are
   unchanging like the even, symmetric normal pendulum," Schatz
   said. "It turns out it's really these unstable patterns that
   form a rough core alphabet that we use to build a sort of
   predictive theory."

   Staying with the dynamics of that floppy inverted pendulum, now
   picture each exact coherent structure as being a city on a map.
   There are paths that guide the turbulent flow "traffic" toward,
   from, and around each city just like roadways. "This road map
   around and between cities does not change in time, which
   enables us to predict the evolution of the flow," Grigoriev
   said.

   ECSs occur regularly, almost like clockwork, opening up the
   possibility of refining predictions at regular intervals.

   Exact coherent structures were already known to exist, Schatz
   said. "What no one has done before is demonstrate in a lab
   experiment how they can be harnessed to describe dynamics, the
   behavior evolving in time, which is really what you need for
   prediction."

   Mining weather data

   In the 19th century, math equations were developed to describe
   the basic flow of fluids. Those who took high school physics
   may remember Newton's Second Law relating forces, acceleration
   and mass. The Navier-Stokes equations, used in this study,
   apply it to fluids.

   Turbulence is challenging to describe mathematically because
   its swirls contain myriad dimensions, with the flow in each
   small region appearing to dance to its own tune. But there is
   clear order that emerges upon finding exact coherent
   structures.

   To make their predictions, Schatz and Grigoriev's research team
   devised a way to mathematically connect that high
   dimensionality to the much simpler roadway concept.

   They broke down the turbulent flow into regions, each small
   enough to apply the equations, then used their solutions to
   precisely place the flows on the road map.

   Today, the compendium of data on weather and climate, the shape
   of ocean floors, dimensions of the atmosphere, effects of
   gravity, rotation, or concentrations of dissolved minerals is
   impressive and growing.

   Predictive methods like those in this research offer paths into
   that data to extract better predictions from it.
