            That’s fine as far as it goes, but how about
            enlightening us about the relevance of braid group
            reps?

            That’s another story! For what Kosterlitz, Haldane and
            Thouless did, this is very good:
            • The Nobel Prize in Physics 2016, [48]Topological
            phase transitions and topological phases of matter.
            You won’t see any braid group representations in here.
            However, you’ll see how they laid the groundwork, by
            showing how the first Chern class and U(1)
            Chern–Simons theory are important in 1-dimensional and
            2-dimensional magnetic materials.

       What do you mean by “mirror image”?
       As far as I can tell from these pictures, mirroring a
       vortex will just cause it to change direction, i.e. it will
       still be a vortex but, if you look at it from above the
       thin film and it spun around clockwise, after mirroring
       (or, which should be equivalent, changing your perspective
       to looking at the same film from below), you’ll get a
       vortex which spins counterclockwise and vice versa.
       Now for the anti-vortex, things seem a little bit more
       complicated. I can seemingly identify four different axes –
       a) two along the diagonals, b) two as far off them as
       possible – with two different outcomes:
       Mirroring along a) will not change the system at all.
       Mirroring along b) will also reverse direction.
       And I’m currently not able to imagine what happens if you
       look at the same structure from below but I think it might
       end up reversing the direction just like for normal
       vortices.
       Here is another puzzle: What about higher winding numbers?
       I tried scribbling on paper and I think I found a shape
       that basically traces out a lemniscate which should
       correspond to a vortex of winding number 2.
       I think I, by a similar process, also found something with
       winding number -2 which seems to look like the above
       anti-vortex in its hyperbolic-plane-y pattern but with a
       total of six spokes instead of four, if that makes sense.
       Do these also occur? Can it happen, that you, for instance,
       spontaneously get two anti-vortices and a 2-vortex, where
       the 2-vortex stays in place and the two anti-vortices fly
       apart?
       Or alternatively, once you are in this new phase where
       these things become common, will two vortices or
       anti-vortices merge to become 2-vortices or -2-vortices
       respectively?

            I mean that we take the picture, hold it in front of
            us facing away, and look at its image in a mirror. For
            example, the mirror image of this:

                 Oh, so “kram1032” is you! Hi!
                 Yes, your solutions seem correct. I just didn’t
                 want to give away the answers prematurely.
                 One can certainly draw vector fields with larger
                 winding number, either positive or negative. I’m
                 fairly sure that, like the basic vortex and
                 antivortex configurations, these ‘n-vortices’
                 will have infinite energy unless n is zero.
                 I don’t really know anything about these
                 n-vortices. I would guess that below the
                 Kosterlitz-Thouless transition there’s a pretty
                 good description of the system as a gas of
                 vortex-antivortex pairs, and above it as a dense
                 plasma of vortices and antivortices, without any
                 need to consider n-vortices with |n| > 1.
                 However, I could easily be wrong! I haven’t read
                 any of the extensive literature on this subject!

            Thanks. But we should thank Richard Skinner!
            There are many more images that should be included
            here, which I can see in my mind. Let me describe two:
            1) Start with this:
            [vortex.jpg?w=250]
            Then, rotate each arrow about its tail at the same
            rate. At any moment in time we’ll have a picture that
            physicists would call a vortex—but they’ll look
            dramatically different.
            2) Start with this:
            [anti-vortex.jpg?w=250]
            Then, rotate each arrow about its tail at the same
            rate. At any moment in time we’ll have a picture that
            physicists would call an antivortex—but they’ll look
            dramatically different.
            In case anyone wants to animate these, here’s the
            math. In the first case, at each point with polar
            coordinates (r,\theta) = (r_0, \theta_0) we draw a
            unit vector pointing in the direction
            \theta = \theta_0 + t at time t. In the second case,
            at each point with polar coordinates (r,\theta) =
            (r_0, \theta_0) we draw a unit vector pointing in the
            direction
            \theta = -\theta_0 + t at time t.

                 Ah, so this is important because we are supposed
                 to think of these vortices as being somehow the

                 Right, in the [79]Landau–Ginzburg model of a 2d
                 superconductor, the field usually called
                 \psi \colon \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{C}
                 is a unit complex number at the minimum of its
                 potential, so we get a field of unit vectors on
                 the plane. Rotating all these vectors by the same
                 angle counts as a ‘global gauge transformation’:
                 that is, we get a new field that counts as
                 physically equivalent.
                 We can also take a continuum limit of the
                 [80]classical XY model, and get a simple model of
                 a 2d ferromagnet in which the atom’s spins are
                 described by a field of unit vectors on the
                 plane, which we can think of as a field of unit
                 complex numbers:
                 \psi \colon \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{C}
                 and the energy is
                 \displaystyle{ \int \int |\nabla \psi|^2 \; dx dy
                 }
                 Rotating all the these unit complex numbers by
                 the same angle gives a new field with the same
                 energy. So, it’s a symmetry of the theory!
                 This symmetry also preserves the ‘winding
                 number’, which is computed as an integral around
                 a large circle in the plane: it’s a way to
                 precisely define the number of vortices minus the
                 number of antivortices.

                 The negative vortices look like the gradient of a
                 scalar field with a saddle point, and using the
                 U(1) symmetry we can transform the positive
                 vortices into the gradient of a local minima or
                 maxima. What’s going on here? If I keep thinking
                 about this does it lead to something fancy like
                 Chern-Simons theory?

                      Chern–Simons theory is certainly related to
                      the work of Kosterlitz, Thouless and
                      especially Haldane. Only U(1) Chern–Simons
                      theory shows up, and that makes it a lot
                      simpler than if we had a nonabelian gauge
                      group. The easiest way to get started is to
                      read this:
                      • The Nobel Prize in Physics 2016,
                      [86]Topological phase transitions and
                      topological phases of matter.
                      It’s really quite well-written.
                      The connection to saddle points, local
                      maxima and local minima is simpler. For
                      that, try this:

                 I think that “shifting” is an optical illusion.
                 Knowing Greg, he would have firmly nailed the
                 tail of each arrow to a fixed location. The tails
                 would still seem to shift, since our eyes’ main
                 way of locating an object is relative to other
                 objects, and the heads of the arrows are moving
                 around.

       Very interesting.
       Can you say some words about what your cobordism hypothesis
       is (or was before it became a theorem) and whether and how
       it fits in here?

            [122]8 October, 2016 at 3:32 pm
            The cobordism hypothesis arose from attempts to
            classify topological quantum field theories. Very
            roughly, a field theory is called “topological” if
            it’s invariant under all diffeomorphisms of spacetime.
            The theory studied by Kosterlitz and Thouless is not
            topological in this sense. However, it introduced
            topological considerations into condensed matter
            physics in a way that ultimately led to a very
            fruitful interaction between that subject and
            topological quantum field theory.
            As for what the cobordism hypothesis is, my best
            explanation is here:

                 It turns out that the most exciting qualitative
                 properties of topological phases are often
                 summarized by topological quantum field theories,
                 even for phases arising from theories that are
                 not themselves topological.

       Looking at the mirror for helical vortices/antivortices is
       the same as rotating the picture around x or y axes. So
       here, parity is changed by a 180 deg rotation.

       I had a bit of fun trying to simulate this system. Here is

       IFRAME:
       l=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=
       1&wmode=transparent


       Positive vortices are blue, and negative vortices are green
       (it’s not totally accurate because the lattice is
       discrete.) It looks like vortices attract, which makes
       sense given your description of the infinite energy of an
       isolated vortex. The temperature is way below the
       Kosterlitz–Thouless transition. Raising the temperature to
       that point it just becomes a big mess.

            Excellent! Yes, a vortex will attract an antivortex,
            since their total energy goes to infinity as you pull
            them apart taking their distance to infinity.
            Now that I think of it, this is similar to how a
            quark-antiquark pair in a meson increases in energy
            roughly linearly as you pull them apart. In that
            situation the field energy is concentrated in a ‘flux
            tube’ connecting the quarks. Eventually there’s enough
            energy to create a new quark-antiquark pair: the flux
            tube gets cut into two shorter flux tubes.
            (I don’t have a good mental image of where the field
            energy lies when you have a distant vortex-antivortex
            pair, so I don’t know if it mainly lies in a ‘tube’
            connecting the two.)
            I wonder if there’s visible dramatic change near the
            Kosterlitz–Thouless transition. Google leads me to
            this picture:

            but I don’t know exactly what it means. The lower

                 I did some more experimenting and came up with
                 this:

                 I added a “heat map” to show how much energy each
                 compass needle has, and also varied the
                 temperature so that you can see the onset of the
                 KT transition. It does look like there are
                 tendrils of excitation extending between the
                 vortices, but it’s hard to see.

       Many thanks for your fascinating insights on this
       phenomenon, John. Please forgive my naivete, but what
       minimum temperature is required to spontaneously create a
       vortex-antivortex pair? Can it occur at 0 K? Is there any
       connection to the creation of electron-positron pairs?

            At absolute zero any physical system will definitely
            be in its lowest-energy state, or a randomly chosen
            lowest-energy state if there is more than one. Since a
            vortex-antivortex pair has more energy than a state in
            which all the spins are aligned, you’ll never see a
            vortex-antivortex pair at absolute zero.
            For any physical system as soon as the temperature
            exceeds absolute zero, there’s some nonzero
            probability to find that system in any state. Thus,
            there’s some nonzero probability to find a
            vortex-antivortex pair in any given large region of
            the magnet as soon as the temperature exceeds zero,
            but this probability will be low for low temperatures.
            Kosterlitz and Thouless won the Nobel for discovering
            that this particular system has a phase transition at
            some positive temperature T_0. This means that the
            probability of finding vortex-antivortex pair in any
            given large region of the magnet is not analytic as a
            function of temperature at the point T = T_0. The
            system ‘changes phase’, a bit like ice melting or
            water vaporizing: vortex-antivortex pairs become
            common and the system is qualitatively different.
            This is the famed Kosterlitz–Thouless transition.


     Is there any connection to the creation of electron-positron
     pairs?
            It’s slightly similar: as you heat up any system,
            high-energy states become more probable. Thus as you
            heat up a box of gas, or a box of radiation, to a
            sufficiently high temperature, electron-positron pairs
            will eventually become common. I happen to have worked
            out the temperature a few weeks ago, and it’s roughly
            12 billion kelvin.
            To estimate this, take the mass of the electron and
            convert it into units of energy. The answer is 0.511
            MeV, where MeV or ‘million electron volts’ is a common
            unit of energy in particle physics. Multiply by two to
            get the energy of a positron-electron pair: roughly 1
            MeV. Convert this to a temperature using the formula E
            = k_BT where k_B is Boltzmann’s constant. In other
            words, let T = E/k_B. It’s [156]convenient to note
            that 1/k_B is about 12,000 kelvin per eV. Thus, 1 MeV
            divided by Boltzmann’s constant is about
            12,000,000,000 kelvin.
            So, at a temperature of about 12 billion kelvin,
            electron-positron pairs become common. This is not an
            all-or-nothing thing, and I don’t know if there’s a
            phase transition. Someone must know.
            Temperatures were this high in the early Universe, and
            also in the jets produced by black holes, and some
            other extreme situations. Here’s a jet coming out of
            the supermassive black hole at the center of the
            galaxy M87, where this is happening:
            [m87_jet.jpg]
            If I knew the energy of a vortex-antivortex pair, I
            could do a similar calculation to give a rough
            estimate of the temperature at which the
            Kosterlitz–Thouless transition occurs. But I’m sure
            people have worked out the details in a much more
            precise: there’s even a [157]whole book on the
            Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.

            A closely related topological phase transition is
            described by the Quantum Hall Effect and Fractional
            Quantum Hall Effect. That was a hot topic when I was
            in grad school growing GaAs quantum well structures.
            Stormer and Tsui eventually won a Nobel Prize after
            they experimentally discovered the fractional effect
            that Laughlin had predicted.
            I mention this because in last month’s blog post
            linked in my comment above, I stated that I applied
            knowledge of the Hall effect in solving the QBO
            problem. The two phenomenon share similar curl terms.
            The math is the common tie between these systems.
            from [169]“Modeling water waves beyond perturbations”


     “– The perturbation theory is useful when there is a small
     dimensionless parameter in the problem, and the system is
     exactly solvable when the small parameter is sent to zero.
     – … it is not required that the system has a small
     parameter,
     nor that the system is exactly solvable in a certain limit.
     Therefore it has been useful in studying strongly correlated
     systems, such as the fractional Quantum Hall effect.”
            Making progress in one area certainly has application
            in other disciplines.

            In a [176]Type II superconductor, the magnetic field
            is confined in ‘flux tubes’, also known as
            [177]Abrikosov vortices. They act like vortice in the
            following sense: the vector potential A is a vector
            field with
            \nabla \times A = B
            where B is the magnetic field, but B = 0 except inside
            these tubes. Thus, the A is curl-free outside these
            tubes— but it curls around inside these tubes! So, you
            can roughly imagine a flux tube as a little tornado
            but where the wind is the vector potential A.
            But it gets better. Thanks to quantum mechanics, each
            tube carries one ‘quantum of magnetic flux’. That is,
            the integral of the B field over a disk cutting one of
            these tubes is a certain fixed value depending only on
            fundamental constants of nature: the [178]magnetic
            flux quantum!
            If you have a fairly thin film made of a type II
            superconductor, these flux tubes tend to line up at
            right angles to the film. In a homogeneous material,
            they’re happiest forming a lattice! Here’s an actual
            picture of what they look like, created in a lab in
            1989:

            So far this is all sounding fairly similar to what
            Kosterlitz and Thouless were studying. However, I
            believe that in this situation, the antiparticle of a
            vortex is a vortex spinning the other way—that is, a
            mirror-image vortex.

       John,
       Your wording is a bit confusing about the appearance of the
       KT pairs. As Simon Burton’s excellent video shows they
       appear at far below the transition temperature
       T_{\mathrm{KT}} , as the pairing reduces the activation
       energy to a finite number. However they stay bound together
       below T_{\mathrm{KT}} and only break at above T_{\mathrm
       {KT}} (or in Simon’s words “become a big mess”). This is
       what the Nobel committee has to say:


     The insight by Kosterlitz and Thouless was that at a certain
     temperature T_{\mathrm{KT}} the pairs will break up into
     individual vortices. It is this vortex pair unbinding
     transition that will take the system to a high temperature
     phase with exponentially decaying correlations.”
       However in your blog and comments you termed it as “the
       Kosterlitz–Thouless transition is the sudden appearance of
       large numbers of vortex-antivortex pairs as you heat up”,
       which while maybe true (in the sense that more pairs
       certainly will appear as the temperature rises) is not
       quite the same as what the Nobel committee is saying. So
       which one is correct?
       Thanks for the excellent illustrations (and amazing
       contributions from commenters).

            The Nobel committee is, unsurprisingly, correct. In my
            blog article I was trying to say, in a very
            nontechnical way, that various quantities depend on
            the temperature in a way that fails to be analytic
            (i.e., given by a convergent Taylor series) at the
            phase transition. I guessed that the density of
            vortices is one of these quantities. I do not actually
            know this to be true. Since I was in a rush, I made
            the mistake of stating my guess as a fact. Then I made
            the further mistake of trying to express my guess in
            simple terms by saying there’s a “sudden appearance of
            large numbers of vortex-antivortex pairs” as the
            temperature passes through the phase transition.
            I knew full well that the vortex density could fail to
            be non-analytic even without a sudden increase in the
            density as we increase the temperature past the phase
            transition. I felt mildly guilty about this, but
            you’ve simultaneously pointed out the problem and
            pointed to a good expository solution—that is, a nice
            way to explain what’s really happening!
            Briefly: in the Kosterlitz–Thouless transition, the
            vortex-antivortex pairs “unbind” and we get a messy
            soup of vortices and antivortices.
            This reminds me a bit of a quark-gluon plasma. In
            neutronium that’s not too hot, quarks, antiquarks and
            gluons are bound into nucleons, perhaps with some
            mesons hopping around between them. But when we heat
            it up enough, we go through a phase transition called
            ‘deconfinement’, leading to a new state of matter
            called a quark-gluon plasma. In fact the full story
            here is more complicated, more interesting, and not
            fully understood. Click on the image for more:

       Thank you for a very nice explanation of the KT transition.
       Most of the time I don’t have a clue about who the Nobel
       prize winners are, but this is something that I actually
       knew something about, even if it was a long time ago I
       learned about it and my memory is hazy. Let me just point
       out that the phase diagram of the XY model is really weird,
       because there is no ordered phase below the KT transition.
       The point is that domain walls destroy long-range order in
       low dimensions. In 1D a domain wall consists of a single
       pair of opposite spins, which can be excited at any
       non-zero temperature. In 2D you can only have long-range
       order in systems with discrete symmetry, like the Ising
       model. In systems with continuous symmetry, the energy of a
       domain wall decreases with its thickness. The cost of
       exciting a very thick domain wall is neglible, so again
       this will happen at any non-zero temperature.
       However, the XY model is a bordering case, because below
       the KT transition the correlation length is infinite
       although there is no long-range order (this is called
       quasi-long-range order). Instead correlation functions
       decay with a power law, and the power depends on
       temperature. So there is a continuum of inequivalent
       critical systems up to the KT transition. Above that, the
       correlation length becomes finite.
       Being 2D critical systems, this continuum is described by a
       continuum of inequivalent CFTs, all with c = 1.

            subtleties about the XY model are part of why experts
            got so excited about the Kosterlitz–Thouless
            transition: it opened up new worlds that hadn’t been
