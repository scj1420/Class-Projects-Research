   This book offers a comprehensive overview of time series
   analysis. The author says that he aimed the book at a broad
   audience that includes students, practitioners, and scientists
   from fields ranging from hydrology to sociology to finance. The
   focus throughout is on methodologies and techniques selected to
   help the reader develop a working knowledge of practical
   applications of time series methods. Most of the book deals
   with time series that arise from stochastic processes observed
   at discrete times and recorded at regular intervals. Even
   restricted in this way, the analysis of time series is a vast
   subject. The author manages to incorporate a huge number of
   topics and his book verges on the encyclopedic.

   Although the introduction suggests that “some basic knowledge
   of calculus” is required for understanding most methods
   described here, that substantially understates the necessary
   prerequisites. More realistically, these would include a
   working command of probability and statistics, a good bit of
   matrix analysis, more than a little real analysis, some
   knowledge of the Fourier transform and signal processing
   techniques, and facility with manipulating infinite series. A
   big dose of mathematical maturity is needed as well.

   The book begins with a series of examples of times series
   arising in applications from several different fields. These
   illustrate the main features that incur in time series, the
   kinds of data transformations that can be helpful and
   circumstances that typically require special treatment. The
   first chapter also introduces some important notions: serial
   dependence, stationarity, testing for whiteness of spectrum,
   parametric and non-parametric modeling, and forecasting.

   The main subjects of the book are linear processes, state space
   models, spectral analysis, estimation methods and prediction.
   The author also has extended treatments of nonstationary
   processes, seasonality, regression and the question of how one
   handles missing values and outliers. Time series analysis, more
   than any field I’m aware of, is almost overwhelmed by its own
   acronyms. Practically speaking one can get by with just a few,
   but happily the author has provides a glossary to help sort out
   terms like FIGARCH, GARCH, APARCH and LSARFIMA.

   It is clear almost from the beginning that this is not a book
   for those new to the field. A linear process is defined right
   at the beginning of Chapter 2 in terms of a linear filter on
   the backshift operator, and then an infinite series expression
   for the filter is provided. This is very general, and perhaps
   elegant, but it is hardly illuminating for any reader who might
   be new to the subject. There are certainly clearer and more
   transparent ways to define a linear process, and one might have
   hoped that the author had started there. At least a simple
   example of two might be warranted. Instead, the author moves on
   immediately to a discussion of stationarity.

   This is a book that would likely be of more use to a serious
   practitioner of time series analysis than anyone coming fresh
   to the subject. The author includes too many things, moves
   through them too quickly and at too high a level to make this
   anything like an introductory book. For example, the author
   devotes two pages to the topic of wavelets in discussing
   spectral analysis. Similarly, observability and controllability
   (important concepts from control theory) get two pages in the
   chapter on state space models. This might work if the author
   were reviewing concepts for well-established practitioners, but
   it clearly won’t work for other readers.
