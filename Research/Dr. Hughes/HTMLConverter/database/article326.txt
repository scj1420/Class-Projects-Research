Solution to last week’s Riddler Classic

   Congratulations to 👏 Anders Skjäl 👏 of Åbo, Finland, winner of
   [28]last week’s Classic puzzle!


   A giant troll captures 10 dwarves and locks them up in his
   cave. The following morning, he will decide their fate through
   a series of rules. The troll will randomly place a white or
   black dot on each dwarf’s head. He’ll then line them up single
   file, shortest to tallest, so that each dwarf can see all the
   shorter dwarves in front of him — and their dots — but none of
   the taller dwarves behind him. Starting with the tallest, each
   dwarf will be asked the color of his dot. If he gets the color
   wrong, the troll kills him. If he gets it right, he’s magically
   and instantly transported to safety. Each dwarf can hear the
   answers of the others, but does not know whether they are
   killed or saved. The dwarves have the night to hatch a plan.
   What strategy can they use so that the fewest dwarves die, and
   how many dwarves can be saved?

   Nine of the 10 dwarves can be saved for sure and, with a little
   luck, all 10 will escape the troll’s clutches. How? The dwarves
   agree on the following plan: The first, tallest dwarf will risk
   life and limb to save the others. Since he has no information
   to go on to determine his own dot’s color, he can use his guess
   to inform the others. The dwarves agree that if the number of
   white dots the tallest dwarf sees is even, he should say
   “white,” and if it’s odd, he should say “black.”

   That first dwarf only has a 50-50 chance of survival, but all
   of his compatriots will now survive for sure because they know
   why he said the color he said. Suppose the first dwarf says
   “white,” meaning he sees an even number of white dots. Then
   it’s the second dwarf’s turn. If he also sees an even number of
   white dots, then he knows for sure that his dot is black. If,
   instead, he sees an odd number of white dots, then he knows for
   sure that his dot is white. Based on the responses of the first
   two dwarves, the third can then also determine the “evenness”
   or “oddness” of the remaining white dots. If what he sees
   matches that, his must be black, if not, white, and so on.

   Regardless of how many dwarves there are (say there are N), at
   least N-1 can be saved for sure, and all N can be saved half
   the time! Your fellow dwarves thank you, tallest dwarf.
