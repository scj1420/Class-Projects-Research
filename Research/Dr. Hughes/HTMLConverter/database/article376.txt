Problem

   After a long disagreement, Mr. Black, Mr. Gray and Mr. White
   agree to enter into a three-way duel, or a [49]truel. They will
   stand in a triangle formation, each positioned at the vertices,
   each equidistant from the other two shooters.


   Mr. Black is the worst shot, he only hits 1/3 of the time, so
   he gets to shoot first. Mr. Gray is second-worst, hitting 2/3
   of the time, so he get's to shoot second. Mr. White is an ace,
   and he hits 100 percent of the time, so he will have to wait
   and shoot third. The three men will take turns shooting in this
   order until only one man is left standing.
