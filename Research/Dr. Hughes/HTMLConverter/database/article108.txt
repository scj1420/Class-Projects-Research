            You seem to have become a Twitter superstar based on a
            bad math joke. Hmm. [144][DEL: # :DEL] careerMoves

            I was pretty impressed with your ability to predict
            its success. Looks like any other bad math joke to me

            This is the 2nd Fibonacci joke I've heard today and
            it's exactly the same as the first one.
