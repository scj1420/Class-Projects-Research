   John Friedlander of the University of Toronto and Henryk
   Iwaniec of Rutgers University will receive the 2017 AMS Joseph
   L. Doob Prize. The two are honored for their book Opera de
   Cribro (AMS, 2010).

   The prime numbers, the building blocks of the whole numbers,
   have fascinated humankind for millennia. While it has been
   known since the time of Euclid that the number of primes is
   infinite, exactly how they are distributed among the whole
   numbers is still not understood. The Latin title of the
   prizewinning book by Friedlander and Iwaniec could be
   translated as A Laborious Work Around the Sieve, where in this
   context a "sieve" is a mathematical tool for sifting prime
   numbers out of sets of whole numbers.

   The Sieve of Eratosthenes, dating from the third century BC, is
   a simple, efficient method to produce a table of prime numbers.
   For a long time, it was the only way to study the mysterious
   sequence of the primes. In the early 20th century, improvements
   came through the work of Norwegian mathematician Viggo Brun,
   who combined the Sieve of Eratosthenes with ideas from
   combinatorics. Tools from another branch of mathematics,
   complex analysis, came into play through the work of English
   mathematicians G.H. Hardy and J.E. Littlewood, and of the
   iconic Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan (protagonist of
   the 2016 film The Man Who Knew Infinity).

   For 30 years, Brun's method and its refinements were the main
   tools in sieve theory. Then, in 1950, another Norwegian
   mathematician, Atle Selberg, put forward a new, simple, and
   elegant method. As his method was independent of that of Brun,
   the combination of the two gave rise to deep new results.

   The latter part of the 20th century saw the proof of many
   profound results on classical prime-number questions that had
   previously been considered inaccessible. Among these was a
   formula for the number of primes representable as the sum of a
   square and of a fourth power, obtained by Friedlander and
   Iwaniec in 1998.

   With these developments, the time was ripe for a new book
   dealing with prime-number sieves and the techniques needed for
   their applications. Written by two of the top masters of the
   subject, Opera de Cribro is an insightful and comprehensive
   presentation of the theory and application of sieves. In
   addition to providing the latest technical background and
   results, the book looks to the future by raising new questions,
   giving partial answers, and indicating new ways of approaching
   the problems.

   With high-quality writing, clear explanations, and numerous
   examples, the book helps readers understand the subject in
   depth. "These features distinguish this unique monograph from
   anything that had been written before on the subject and lift
   it to the level of a true masterpiece," the prize citation
   says.

   The two prizewinners collaborated on an expository article on
   number sieves, "[114]What is the Parity Phenomenon?", which
   appeared in the August 2009 issue of the AMS Notices.


   Born in Toronto, John Friedlander received his BSc from the
   University of Toronto and his MA from the University of
   Waterloo. In 1972, he earned his PhD at Pennsylvania State
   University under the supervision of S. Chowla. His first
   position was that of assistant to Atle Selberg at the Institute
   for Advanced Study. After further positions at IAS, the
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Scuola Normale
   Superiore in Pisa, and the University of Illinois at
   Urbana-Champaign, he returned to the University of Toronto as a
   faculty member in 1980. He was Mathematics Department Chair
   from 1987 to 1991 and since 2002 has been University Professor
   of Mathematics. He was awarded the Jeffery-Williams Prize of
   the Canadian Mathematical Society (1999) and the CRM-Fields
   (currently CRM-Fields-PIMS) Prize of the Canadian Mathematical
   Institutes (2002). He gave an invited lecture at the
   International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich in 1994. He
   is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, a Founding Fellow
   of the Fields Institute, and a Fellow of the AMS.

   Born in Elblag, Poland, Henryk Iwaniec graduated from Warsaw
   University in 1971 and received his PhD in 1972. In 1976 he
   defended his habilitation thesis at the Institute of
   Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences and was elected
   to member correspondent. He left Poland in 1983 to take
   visiting positions in the USA, including long stays at the
   Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In 1987, he was
   appointed to his present position as New Jersey State Professor
   of Mathematics at Rutgers University. He was elected to the
   American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1995), the US National
   Academy of Sciences (2006), and the Polska Akademia
   Umiejetnosci (2006, foreign member). He has received numerous
   prizes including the Sierpinski Medal (1996), the Ostrowski
   Prize (2001, shared with Richard Taylor and Peter Sarnak), the
   AMS Cole Prize in Number Theory (2002, shared with Richard
   Taylor), the AMS Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition
   (2011), the Banach Medal of the Polish Academy of Sciences
   (2015), and the Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences (2015,
   shared with Gerd Faltings). He was an invited speaker at the
   International Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki (1978),
   Berkeley (1986), and Madrid (2006).


   Presented every three years, the AMS Doob Prize recognizes a
   single, relatively recent, outstanding research book that makes
   a seminal contribution to the research literature, reflects the
   highest standards of research exposition, and promises to have
   a deep and long-term impact in its area. The prize will be
   awarded Thursday, January 5, 2017, at the Joint Mathematics
   Meetings in Atlanta.
