   This week the [35]Mathematical Association of America is
   encouraging math enthusiasts to share their love of the subject
   using the hashtag [36]#loveyourmath. Today’s prompt was to
   “post an image of your favorite math art (and artist), or share
   something you created, or your children created.” I started
   sharing some of my math+art posts on Twitter, but I quickly got
   overwhelmed. I've written about so many (but still somehow not
   enough) things at the intersection of math and art! So here's a
   roundup of my posts about mathematics, art, and the beautiful
   connections between them.
