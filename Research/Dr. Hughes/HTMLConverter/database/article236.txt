   One of the highlights of my teaching career was the day a
   student walked into my classroom with a pseudosphere. It was a
   beautiful pseudosphere, handmade out of wood on a lathe. (He
   [34]wrote about making it on the class blog.) We had been
   talking about the pseudosphere in our math history unit about
   the development of non-Euclidean geometry, but I never dreamed
   that a student would replace my terrible sketches on the
   blackboard with a hefty model, much less one as handsome as
   this one.


   The pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature.
   Curvature is a bit tricky to define rigorously, but it’s not
   too hard to get a feel for what it means. It’s a measure of how
   far a portion of a surface is from being flat. Curvature can be
   positive, negative, or zero. It’s easiest to think about what
   these mean if you imagine sitting on the surface. If you sit on
   a large ball, the surface of the ball curves away from you in
   every direction. That’s positive curvature. If you sit on a
   saddle, the saddle curves away from you in the direction your
   legs are hanging down and up towards you the other direction.
   That’s negative curvature. A surface with zero curvature is
   flat.

   The three types of curvature correspond to three basic types of
   two-dimensional geometry: positive curvature corresponds to
   spherical or [35]elliptic geometry. That’s the kind of geometry
   we do when we’re trying to navigate over large distances on the
   Earth. Zero curvature is familiar Euclidean geometry, and
   negative curvature is [36]hyperbolic geometry. Though some
   mathematicians came close to discovering it a few times, that
   last option, hyperbolic geometry, was not recognized as a
   viable system until the 1830s, when Nikolai Lobachevsky and
   János Bolyai discovered that it was just as consistent as
   Euclidean geometry.


   Johann Lambert, an 18th-century Swiss mathematician, came
   tantalizingly close to discovering (or inventing) hyperbolic
   geometry a few decades before Bolyai and Lobachevsky. [37]In a
   post I wrote two years ago, I shared the following quote from
   one of his papers. The second and third hypotheses he refers to
   basically amount to whether the infamous Euclidean parallel
   postulate is violated in the spherical direction, which yields
   triangles with an interior angle sum greater than 180 degrees,
   or in the hyperbolic direction, which yields triangles with an
   interior angle sum less than 180 degrees.


     To come back to the third hypothesis. As we have just seen,
     under this hypothesis the sum of the three angles in every
     triangle is less than 180 degrees, or two right angles. But
     the difference up to 180 degrees increases like the area of
     the triangle...
     I will add just the following remark. Entirely analogous
     theorems hold under the second hypothesis except that under
     it the angle sum in every triangle is greater than 180
     degrees. The excess is always proportional to the area of
     the triangle.
     I think it remarkable that the second hypothesis holds if
     instead of a plane triangle we take a spherical one, for its
     angle sum is greater than 180 degrees and the excess is also
     proportional to the area of the triangle….
     From this I should almost conclude that the third hypothesis
     holds on some imaginary sphere.

   The pseudosphere is that imaginary sphere.

   Well, sort of. Lambert was referring to the [38]area formula
   for spherical triangles, which states that if the radius of a
   sphere is some number R and the angles of a triangle on that
   sphere are a, b, and c, then the area of that triangle is
   (a+b+c-π)R^2. Lambert discovered that if you assume what he
   called the “third hypothesis” (and mathematicians now would
   think of as the hyperbolic version of the parallel postulate)
   the area of a triangle with angles a, b, and c would be
   (π-a-b-c)R^2, where R was a constant. So he had noticed that if
   we plugged an imaginary number into the formula for the area of
   the sphere, replacing R with iR, where i^2=-1, we would get
   exactly the formula for triangle area that he had discovered
   assuming the third hypothesis.


   The pseudosphere is not defined by equations that are
   equivalent to replacing the radius of a sphere with an
   imaginary number. But I still believe Lambert’s remarks
   foreshadowed this lovely figure. The pseudosphere’s name comes
   from the fact that it shares an important feature of the
   sphere: it has constant curvature. There are other objects,
   like eggs, with positive curvature everywhere, but a sphere is
   the only object with constant positive curvature. Every point
   of the sphere looks the same from the standpoint of curvature.
   Likewise, a pseudosphere, except for at the sharp cusp in the
   middle, has constant negative curvature. That makes it a
   natural habitat for hyperbolic geometry just like a sphere is
   the natural habitat for spherical geometry. Unlike in the case
   of positive curvature, the pseudosphere is not unique in this
   property. There are many, many surfaces with constant negative
   curvature that are not equivalent to one another in other ways.

   To make a pseudosphere, you take a [39]tractrix, a curve in the
   plane first studied by Louvre architect [40]Claude Perrault
   (who unfortunately didn’t see fit to use it in the Louvre) in
   1670, and rotate it around an axis.

   In 1868, Italian mathematician [43]Eugenio Beltrami published a
   paper about [44]how the pseudosphere could be used to realize
   the non-Euclidean geometry Lobachevsky had written about
   decades earlier.

   At the top of this post, I have given the pseudosphere the
   Magritte treatment by pointing out “Ceci n’est pas une
   pseudosphère.” The treachery of this pseudosphere is not the
   [47]treachery of Magritte’s famous non-pipe. It isn’t just that
   this pseudosphere is pixels on a screen instead of the real,
   three-dimensional object. No, this wooden model, as gorgeous as
   it is, is not a pseudosphere either. Aside from whatever small
   errors were introduced by working with real materials in the
   real world, the tractrix is an infinite curve, and the
   pseudosphere therefore continues forever in both directions.
   Mathematical objects are not the same as real-world objects,
   and I could append this disclaimer onto any picture of a
   mathematical object I include in a post. But I think it looks
   especially classy accompanying this particular mathematical
   model.
