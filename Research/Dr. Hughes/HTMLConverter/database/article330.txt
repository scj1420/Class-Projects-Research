   This is the fifth edition of an introductory text for graduate
   students. Morgan describes geometric measure theory as
   “differential geometry, generalized through measure theory to
   deal with maps and surfaces that are not necessarily smooth,
   and applied to the calculus of variations”. He calls the book
   an illustrated introduction, and his treatment is friendly
   enough (though still rigorous) that it does not intimidate.
   (Immediate intimidation was the effect on me some years ago by
   Federer’s book on the same subject.)

   It’s still not an easy subject. But Morgan’s treatment
   skillfully draws on the reader’s intuition, and uses historical
   connections to develop the critical ideas and place them in a
   broader context. Morgan is very good at explaining how all the
   pieces fit together, what matters most and why the difficult
   parts are difficult. He is adept at using pictures to explain
   the importance of the main ideas. His focus is on geometry.
   Most of the hard results (largely analytical in character) are
   not proved here.

   The book is divided into two parts of about equal length. The
   first part develops the basic theory, and the second takes up
   applications. Using the archetypal example of finding the
   surface of least area in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) with a given
   boundary, Morgan describes how an approach using the concept of
   rectifiable currents gives a natural topology on the space of
   surfaces that is dual to an appropriate topology on
   differential forms. A key result of the first part is the
   existence of area-minimizing surfaces in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). Its
   proof depends on Federer’s compactness theorem, which Federer
   proved using his own amazing result on the structure of
   arbitrary subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^n\).

   A highlight of the second part is a sketch of the proof in
   \(\mathbb{R}^3\) of the Double Bubble conjecture: the familiar
   standard double soap bubble consisting of three spherical caps
   meeting at 120 degrees along a common circle encloses two
   prescribed volumes in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) with the minimum surface
   area. (An analogous result holds in \(\mathbb{R}^n\).)

   Other conjectures and failed conjectures appear here too. The
   Hexagonal Honeycomb Conjecture says that regular hexagons
   provide the most efficient (least perimeter) way to divide the
   plane into unit areas. Thomas Hales proved the result in 1999,
   and a sketch is given here; its proof depends on a fairly
   intricate isoperimetric inequality. A failed conjecture due to
   Lord Kelvin states that truncated octahedrons partition
   three-dimensional space into regions of unit volumes with the
   least surface area. Weaire and Phelan, inspired by the natural
   crystal structure of a clathrate compound, found a
   counterexample in 1999. It beats Kelvin’s idea by a bare 0.3%.

   Two other topics here might be of potentially broader interest.
   Both concern the current hot topic of manifolds with density.
   The first is a brief treatment of the use of this idea by
   Perelman in his proof of the Poincaré conjecture. The second is
   Chambers log-convex density theorem: balls about the origin are
   isoperimetric for a smooth radial density if and only if the
   log of the density is convex.

   Morgan’s book offers the best access I know into this difficult
   subject. It won’t make the reader an expert, but it does open
   the door to more detailed treatments. An excellent bibliography
   is provided.
