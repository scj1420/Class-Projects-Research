  The Panic President



   Rarely does a leader in a liberal democracy embrace, let alone
   foment, fear. But that’s exactly what Donald Trump did in
   response to attacks in London, as he has often done before.

   After a terrorist attack, there are two steps nearly every
   leader takes: first, condemn the violence; second, appeal for
   calm. London Mayor Sadiq Khan followed that familiar playbook
   in the wake of Saturday night’s attacks. [91]Speaking to the
   BBC, Khan said:


     There aren’t words to describe the grief and anger that our
     city is feeling today. I’m appalled and furious that these
     cowardly terrorists would deliberately target innocent
     Londoners and bystanders enjoying their Saturday night.
     There can be no justification for the acts of these
     terrorists, and I’m quite clear that we will never let them
     win, nor will we allow to cower our city.

   Then Khan went on reassure the public:

     Londoners will see an increased police presence today and
     over the course of the next few days. No reason to be
     alarmed. One of the things, the police, all of us need to
     do, is make sure we’re as safe as we possibly can be. I’m
     reassured that we are one of the safest global cities in the
     world, if not the safest global city in the world, but we
     always evolve and review ways to make sure that we remain as
     safe as we possibly can.
