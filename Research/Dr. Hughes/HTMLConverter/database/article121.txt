  Hedge Funds

   So who has the best Erdos Numbers in hedge funds?

   James Simons, the billionaire founder of Renaissance
   Technologies, the most successful quant hedge fund of all time,
   clocks in at a 3. Simons collaborated with Shiing-Shen Chern on
   a 1971
   paper, “Some Cohomology Classes in Principal Fiber Bundles and
   Their Application to Riemannian Geometry.” Chern collaborated
   with Aurel Wintner, who collaborated with Erdos.

   David E. Shaw, the computer scientist who started a now $40
   billion hedge fund, and John Overdeck, co-founder of $37
   billion quant-fund Two Sigma, are 4’s, as is Anthony Ledford,
   chief scientist at Man Group Plc’s
   $19 billion AHL unit.

   Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrom, who won this year’s Nobel
   Prize in Economics, have Erdos Numbers of 3 and 4,
   respectively. On average, Nobel laureates in economics come in
   at 5, Oakland University’s Grossman said.

   Born in Budapest in 1913, Erdos (pronounced "air-dosh") could
   multiply three-digit numbers in his head by the age of three.
   He learned negative numbers at the age of four, Paul Hoffman
   wrote in the biography, “The Man Who Loved Only Numbers.” Erdos
   wrote more than 50 of his papers in his seventies alone --
   which is more than most mathematicians pen in a lifetime,
   Hoffman wrote. When he died, in 1996, Erdos left behind a
   remarkable legacy of mathematical collaboration.

   The Erdos Number isn’t taken seriously enough to be used in
   recruiting quants in any way, said Jean-Philippe Bouchaud,
   chairman of $7.2 billion quant fund Capital Fund Management in
   Paris. It’s more of an interesting point for those among the
   top mathematical minds.

   “It shows the small-world effect,” said Bouchaud, a physicist
   whose Erdos number is 3.
