            i just have to ask, who on earth spends time in
            something other than base 2, base 8, base 10, or base
            16?

            For me not a pattern, juste another way to write that
            n(n+1)=(n-1)(n+2)+2

       (n-1)*(n-2)=n^2-3n+2=n*(n-3)+2 in base n is (n-3)2 qed.

            And in base 16: F x E = D2. I'd like to see a proof.
            It shouldn't be to hard.

            The proof/math is quite simple: (b-1)(b-2) = bb -2b -b

       That is cool ... works because (n-1)(n-2)=(n)(n-3)+2 .
       Works in bases>10 too: in hex, (F)(E)=D2
