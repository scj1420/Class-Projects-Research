   HOUSTON, Oct. 26, 2016 - Answering the call for more high
   school math and science teachers, the University of Houston is
   using a $1.45 million National Science Foundation (NSF) grant
   to bolster its teachHOUSTON math and science teacher
   preparation program in a big way.

   Now in its ninth year, teachHOUSTON was awarded the five-year
   grant from the NSF's Robert Noyce Scholarship Program to
   further its mission of supporting future teachers in the STEM
   fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, as
   well as promote long-term teacher retention. The funds are
   being used to introduce a new program that offers scholarships,
   professional development and mentoring.

   A collaboration between the College of Natural Sciences and
   Mathematics (NSM) and the College of Education, the
   teachHOUSTON program addresses the shortage of qualified STEM
   teachers in secondary education. Students enrolled in this
   track participate in field-based teaching experiences
   throughout the four years they are working on their bachelor's
   degree, graduating not only with a math or science degree, but
   also a teaching certificate.

   "This track, which acts as a students' NSM capstone, offers
   hands-on teaching experience, develops effective communication
   skills and gives students the option of teaching after
   graduation," said Paige Evans, a clinical associate professor
   with teachHOUSTON and principal investigator (PI) for the
   grant. "This grant will help us provide our pre-service
   teachers and graduates with the support they need to be
   successful."

   Together with her co-PIs - associate professor of physics Donna
   Stokes, assistant professor of biology and biochemistry Steven
   Bark and associate professor in the College of Education
   Catherine Horne - Evans will establish UH-LIFE, which is short
   for University of Houston: Learning through Informal and Formal
   Experience, to augment existing teachHOUSTON activities.
   Specifically, this new program will provide scholarships for
   pre-service STEM teachers and support the creation of the Noyce
   Professional Development/Mentoring Institute, which will pair
   current students with teachHOUSTON graduates.

   "This institute will connect graduates with undergraduates, so
   that when students graduate and start teaching, they will
   already have a mentor in place to help them," Evans said.

   As part of this institute, teachHOUSTON will host
   undergraduates for a week in the summer to spend time with UH
   alumni who are working as teachers. Professional development
   activities will include the exchange of lesson plans and
   techniques for managing classrooms. Current teachHOUSTON
   students also will be given the opportunity to work as camp
   counselors in a summer STEM camp for middle school students.
   Facilitating STEM activities provides them with valuable
   hands-on experience, as well as teaches them how to pass along
   their own enthusiasm of STEM to their future students.

   "The teachHOUSTON program is great, because it advocates
   hands-on learning for students," said Jamie Lehnen, a current
   Noyce scholar with a major in biochemical and biophysical
   sciences and a minor in chemistry and education. "The program's
   long-term goal is not just to improve test scores and help
   students graduate. Rather, the program's largest goal is to
   make science and mathematics enjoyable to students by showing
   them how applicable STEM is. We want students to learn by
   experimentation, by active collaboration and by thoughtful
   inquiry, which will help them retain the concepts."

   Another component of the UH-LIFE program will be to establish a
   collaboration with Wharton County Junior College, with Wharton
   students being given the opportunity to enroll in this track
   and participate in summer institute activities at UH.

   "Students can take the first two courses while they are at
   Wharton, where they'll also be given opportunities to
   participate in internships at UH," Evans said. "Then, when they
   transfer to UH, they'll already have a sense of belonging."

   That sense of belonging is especially important when studying
   STEM, said Lehnen, noting that sometimes STEM education can be
   dismaying and a lot of hard work.

   "You need to find a community or network of people you feel
   encouraged by and have a support system that applauds your
   efforts, supports your failures and, ultimately, solidifies
   your passion for STEM and education," Lehnen said. "One
   community always willing to lend you support is teachHOUSTON.
   Over time, teachHOUSTON becomes your family."

   Jessica Itzep, a biochemistry and biophysics senior in the
   program and also a current Noyce scholar, echoes this
   sentiment.

   "TeachHOUSTON is a tight-knit community composed of other NSM
   students who share the same passion for science and, like me,
   also want to convey that passion to others," Itzep said. "This
   program offers a variety of unique opportunities for those who
   enjoy science and wish to reach out to others academically."

   The Noyce grant will fund 72 scholarships for students with
   junior or senior standing. Eight scholarships will be offered
   during the first year, with 16 scholarships per year being
   offered during years 2-5 of the grant. Seventeen percent of
   these scholarship funds will be designated for Wharton College
   students who have transferred to UH, while the remaining
   scholarships will be available to all teachHOUSTON students.

   "This grant will let us increase the level of support we can
   offer, both to pre-service teachers and to graduates of our
   program who are currently teaching," Evans said. "Our goal is
   for every student to have a scholarship during their semester
   as a student-teacher so that they have the financial support
   they need to focus on their teaching. The support from this
   grant is critical for the long-term retention and success of
   teachers."

   Lehnen and Itzep agree.

   "I am very grateful to have received the Noyce scholarship and
   have access to all of the wonderful professional development
   opportunities that came along with being a Noyce scholar,"
   Itzep said. "It was a great financial relief and with it I have
   been able to attend a conference where I was able to expand my
   professional network and make friends from the Noyce
   community."

   Lehnen adds, "Getting this scholarship means I have more time
   to enjoy my education and to pursue occupations I love. I don't
   have to stress so much about tuition and book costs, which
   means instead of waiting tables or working full time, I can go
   into the local area and teach."


   Throughout the life of the grant, Cheryl Craig with Texas A&M
   University will serve as the program's external evaluator,
   conducting research on the grant to determine whether it
   effectively meets its goals. For more information on the
