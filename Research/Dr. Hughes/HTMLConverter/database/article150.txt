An 86 mph fastball

   [83]Donald Young, still sweating from his second-round loss to
   [84]Philipp Kohlschreiber, smiled in his interview chair when a
   quiz was proposed.


   Who possesses the fastest average forehand in the game?

   "Uh, maybe del Potro?" said Young, tentatively.

   The answer, it turns out, is fellow American [85]Jack Sock,
   whose extreme Western grip and superior torque gives him a
   blazing 86.33 mph fastball. Reid was quick to point out that
   these numbers don't account for spin, so the flatter (and
   closer to the net) the ball flies, the faster it goes.

   There's no sign of [86]Rafael Nadal on the top-20 list, but
   [87]Stan Wawrinka is seventh, at 81.31, with [88]Tomas Berdych
   11th at 80.47 and [89]Milos Raonic 18th at 79.94.


   Who's the fastest woman on the forehand side?

   That would be another American, 21-year-old [90]Madison Keys,
   who comes in at 81.29 mph.


   "Whoa," said Young. "She really gives it a good ride."

   The surprising thing? Keys is ranked eighth overall -- ahead of
   most men.

   [91]Serena Williams, surprisingly, is not among the top 20 --
   outhit by fellow Americans [92]Christina McHale (ninth, 77.3),
   [93]Coco Vandeweghe (16th, 76.0) and [94]Nicole Gibbs (17th,
   75.91).


   Sock himself was not overly impressed.

   "I think everyone who I play knows I look to hit a forehand and
   it has a lot of spin on it and RPMs," Sock said after a
   second-round win over Karen Khachanov. "I don't really look at
   the specifics, ever.

   "I'm not a technical person like that at all. I don't know,
   maybe some people it can help. I don't think if I change a
   couple of RPMs on my forehand it's going to make or break
   anything."

   The fastest active backhands go to [95]Lukas Rosol (75.2) and
   Keys (74.62), who ranks seventh among all players.


   "Everyone looks at the Keys numbers and in some respects is
   taken aback," Reid said when asked if any results surprised
   him. "It's amazing how close she approximates what men do, the
   ball flight and how close to net it is. Madison's balls skid
   through the court more than most."

   How about sheer speed around the court?

   "Hmm," said Young, grimacing. "Maybe Monfils? Ferrer?"

   The unexpected answer: Djokovic, who isn't seen as a speed
   merchant, but who does have extraordinary anticipation.

   [96]Simona Halep is the fastest on the women's side.


   "Yeah, it's nice to hear that," Halep said. "Maybe because I'm
   not that tall, that's why I'm fast. It's my advantage, I can
   say -- the speed during the matches, during the game."

   Said Young, "That is super-cool. Tennis doesn't have those
   stats like basketball and baseball."

   Well, it does now.
