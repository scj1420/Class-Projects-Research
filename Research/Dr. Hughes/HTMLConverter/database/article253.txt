   Last: 1889, Next: 2081
   FACT 10: “2017” is a prime in base 8
   Last: 2011, Next: 2111
   In base 8, 2017 is 1039.
   FACT 11: Prime of the form a^2 + b^4
   Last: 1777, Next: 2069
   FACT 12: I turn a prime age in a prime year
   Last: 2011, Next: 2027
   It’s just one of those things I keep track of.
   FACT 13: Number n such that both n and (n+1)/2 are primes
   Last: 1993, Next: 2137
   FACT 14 Lower prime of a difference of 10 between consecutive
   primes
   Last: 1879, Next: 2029
   Here is a list of the largest gaps:
   FACT 15: Smallest palindrome greater than n in bases n and n+1
   Last: 1892, Next: 2146
   Other numbers are smaller in other pairs of bases. 2017 is the
   smallest for bases 31 and 32.
   232 in base 31, 1v1 in base 32 (v=31)
   FACT 16: It's not 2016
   Last: 2015, Next: 2018
   A calendar.
   FACT 17: Number of permutations of n elements not containing
   the consecutive pattern 123
   Last: 349, Next: 13,358
   CORRECTIONS:
   - At [29]1:50 I accidentally say "prime" when I mean
   "palindrome". First spotted by Oliver Feghali.
   - I accidentally gave the prime gap after 1327 as the number of
   non-prime years in-between (33) and not the increase to the
   next prime (34) like I did for all the others. Sorry, that was
   me combining two bits of research without thinking! I should
   have spotted the jarring mismatch of odd and even intervals and
   realised I was not bring consistent. Pointed out by loads of
   people, the first of which was TheActualNuttmegger.
   - The 22 year prime gap ended in the 1970s, not started then
   (1951 to 1973). Spotted by Scottish Chemist.
   - For fact 17, it is actually the permutations for n=7, not 8;
   caught by trigonzobob. The permutation conditions are also more
   complicated that I managed to explain as well ("without double
   - Let me know if you spot anything else.
