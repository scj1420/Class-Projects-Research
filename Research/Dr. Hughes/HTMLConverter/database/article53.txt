SCORE VOTING

   you guessed it

   IFRAME: [14]play/ballot4.html


   How To Count: Simply add up the ratings. Whoever has the
   highest average score, wins. Kind of like Amazon reviews, but
   with democracy. (Note: this is not a ranking system, because
   two candidates can have the same score.)

   So there's our top 6 voting systems: the one we use, and five
   popular alternatives. But how can we tell if these alternatives
   are actually better? What glitches might they have? And which
   voting system – if any – can we say is "the best"?

   Like before, let's simulate 'em.
   [part2.png]

   Remember that simulation of the spoiler effect from earlier?
   Well, here it is again, but now you can switch between the six
   different voting systems! Here's the "spoiler effect"
   simulation again. See how different voting systems deal with
   potential spoilers:

   drag [hexagon.png] to just under [triangle.png] to create a
   spoiler effect.
   then compare the 6 different voting systems:
   (note: in the rare cases there's a tie, i just randomly pick a
   winner)

   IFRAME: [15]play/election1.html


   As you could see, every voting system except First Past The
   Post is immune to the spoiler effect. So, that's it, right?
   Ding dong, the glitch is dead? Just pick any other alternative
   voting system and be done with it?

   But, alas. In getting rid of one glitch, some of these
   alternative voting systems create other glitches – for some,
   the cure is even worse than the disease.

   For example, here's a sim of Instant Runoff Voting. In the
   beginning, Tracy Triangle [triangle.png] is already winning,
   and you're going to move the voters even closer to her.
   Obviously, if a candidate is already winning an election, and
   becomes even more popular, they should still win afterwards,
   right?

   You can probably guess where this is going...

   drag the voters [voters.png] slowly up towards [triangle.png] :

   IFRAME: [16]play/election2.html


   What happened? Originally, [hexagon.png] is eliminated in the
   first round, so [triangle.png] goes against a weaker
   [square.png] , and wins. But when you move the voters closer to
   [triangle.png] , the loser changes! So now, [square.png] is
   eliminated in the first round, which means [triangle.png] goes
   against a stronger [hexagon.png] , and loses.

   Under Instant Runoff, it's possible for a winning candidate to
   lose, by becoming more popular. What a glitch!

   How often does this actually happen in real life? [17]There's a
   couple confirmed examples, and [18]mathematicians estimate this
   glitch would happen about 14.5% of the time. But sadly, we
   can't know for sure, because governments usually don't release
   enough info about the ballots to reconstruct an IRV election &
   double-check the results.


   So, not only is Instant Runoff's glitch as undemocratic as
   First Past The Post's glitch, it's possibly worse – because
   while FPTP's counting method is simple and transparent, Instant
   Runoff is anything but. And a lack of transparency is an even
   deadlier sin nowadays, when our trust in government is already
   so low.

   (But wait! We'll be talking about the risk of strategic voting
   later. Can IRV can make a comeback? Stay tuned...)

   So much for the most popular alternative. What about the
   second-most popular, Borda Count? In this next simulation, you
   move a losing candidate closer to another losing candidate.
   Under FPTP, the spoiler effect would split their votes, making
   both of them lose even more. But watch what happens under Borda
   Count instead...

   drag [hexagon.png] to just slightly left of [square.png] :

   IFRAME: [19]play/election3.html


   Yup. Borda Count has a reverse spoiler effect. Instead of one
   good candidate hurting another good candidate by moving closer,
   with Borda Count, one bad candidate can help another bad
   candidate by moving closer.

   Here's what happened: at first, some voters ranked [square.png]
   > [triangle.png] > [hexagon.png] , but when you moved
   [hexagon.png] closer to [square.png] , those voters then swung
   to ranking [square.png] > [hexagon.png] > [triangle.png] ,
   hurting [triangle.png] enough to make her lose to [square.png]
   .

   Still, Borda's not the worst, and at least it's simpler and
   more transparent than Instant Runoff. But how does Condorcet
   Method compare? When Condorcet picks a winner, it's always the
   “theoretically best” winner – but that's when it picks a
   winner.

   So far, I've just been simulating voters as a single group,
   with a center and some spread. But seeing how polarized
   politics is nowadays, one could imagine several groups of
   voters, with totally different centers. Now, Condorcet tries to
   pick the candidate who beats all other candidates in one-on-one
   races. But with polarized voters, you could end up with a
   Rock-Paper-Scissors-like loop, where a majority of voters
   prefer A to B, B to C, and C to A.

   In certain situations, the other voting systems just had
   glitches. In Condorcet, the voting system crashes. Try it out
   for yourself:

   create your own “condorcet cycle”!
   move the voters [voters.png] in such a way that NOBODY wins:

   IFRAME: [20]play/election4.html


   Now, in actual practice – not that any government actually uses
   this voting system – when Condorcet fails to find a winner, the
   election falls back to another method like Borda Count. But if
   you do that, it'll get the glitches of its backup method. So it
   goes.

   First Past The Post. Instant Runoff. Borda Count. Condorcet
   Method. Those were all the voting systems that use ranking –
   the ones that our math boy, Kenneth Arrow, proved would always
   be unfair or glitchy in some big way. What about the voting
   systems that don't use ranking, like Approval & Score voting?
   Well...

   ...I couldn't come up with a simulation to show their flaws.
   Because, in theory, they don't have many big flaws.

   But that's a really, really, really big “in theory!” It may be
   that, in practice, strategic voters use Approval & Score Voting
   exactly like First Past The Post – only approving or giving 5
   stars to their top candidate, and disapproving or giving 1 star
   to all others, even if they actually like the others. [21](See
   FairVote's critique of Approval Voting, and defense of Instant
   Runoff)


   Then again, even if Approval & Score Voting disincentivize you
   from expressing an honest second choice, FPTP and IRV punish
   you for expressing an honest first choice. Besides, if Approval
   can be "gamed", then that goes double for IRV. [22](See this
   mathematician's critique of FairVote's critique, and defense of
   Approval) So, in the end... [confused shrugging sounds]


   We're gonna need a hecka lot more simulations.

   So, below is a chart [23](source), showing the results of 2.2
   million simulations. A huge variety of scenarios were tested.
   All-honest voters. All-strategic voters. Half-honest,
   half-strategic. Voters who know each others' preferences.
   Voters who don't know each others' preferences. Voters who only
   sorta-know each others' preferences. And so on. You can tell
   that a real mathematician made this chart, because it's makin'
   my eyes bleed:


   [comparison.png]

   Each voting method's results is shown as an ugly-blue bar. The
   further to the right a voting method is, the more it "maximizes
   happiness" for the voters. The higher up a voting method is,
   the simpler it is. And a bar's width shows the range of a
   voting system's performance, given different ratios of
   honest-to-strategic voters.

   The first thing to note is that strategic voting makes voters
   less happy than honest voting – in all voting systems! I was
   very surprised when I first learnt that. (But it makes sense,
   if you think about, say, a crowded room full of people trying
   to talk. Any one person can be "strategic" by shouting over
   others, but if everybody is "strategic", nobody can hear
   anybody, and all you're left with is sore throats and sad
   peeps.)

   The other thing to note is which voting systems make people the
   happiest. If you have mostly honest voters, Score Voting is
   best. (with Borda Count a close second) And if you have mostly
   strategic voters, then both Approval & Score Voting are best.
   (and with strategic voters, IRV does just as bad as FPTP)

   However, those are still computer simulations. How would these
   different voting systems play out in real life? Well, we can't
   just get the DeLorean up to 88, go back in time before the 2016
   election, change the voting system, and see what would
   happen...

   ...or can we?!

   No, no we can't. But last month, researchers did something
   close enough. [24]A polling study asked 1,000+ U.S. registered
   voters to rank & rate the six presidential candidates, to
   simulate who would've won the (popular) vote under different
   voting systems! (But keep in mind that if we had a different
   voting system in the primaries, we'd have different candidates
   entirely. So take this study with a pillar of salt.) The
   results: under Instant Runoff, Condorcet, and Approval Voting,
   the winner would've been Hillary Clinton. But under Score
   Voting, the winner would've been Donald Trump. And under Borda
   Count, the winner would've been... uh... Gary Johnson?


   ?????

   a guesstimated model of the 2016 US election?...
   how Clinton [square.png] wins IRV, Trump [hexagon.png] wins
   Score, and Johnson [triangle.png] wins Borda??

   IFRAME: [25]play/election5.html


   Anyway.

   Before we wrap all this up – remember Kenneth Arrow? The
   infamous mathematician who founded the study of voting systems
   in the 1950's? Well, [26]in an interview 60 years later,
   Kenneth Arrow had this to say, about which voting method he
   likes most now:


   “Well, I’m a little inclined to think that score systems [like
   Approval & Score Voting] where you categorize in maybe three or
   four classes [so, giving a score out of 3 or 4, not 10 or 100]
   probably – in spite of what I said about manipulation
   [strategic voting] – is probably the best.”

   That's as strong an endorsement as you'll ever squeeze out of a
   math-head.

   DEAR JUSTIN [27]“TOTES ADORBZ” TRUDEAU
   (and everyone else around the world pushing for voting reform)


   Thank you for taking this small but powerful first step! We've
   known for way too long that our current voting system – First
   Past The Post – forces voters to be dishonest, creates a
   polarizing "lesser of two evils" scenario, and screws over both
   major and minor candidates.

   However, you're probably only considering Instant Runoff
   Voting. Which, to be fair, is better than than First Past The
   Post, and if it's a choice between just those two, definitely
   go for Instant Runoff. But IRV still has a glitch as
   undemocratic as FPTP's – and worse, in our age of distrust,
   Instant Runoff's lack of transparency may be deadly for
   democracy. Yes, sure, IRV was the best voting system we could
   come up with... [28]in 1870. And since then, IRV has dominated
   the conversation, unwittingly framing the whole voting reform
   debate as “simple vs expressive”.


   But that is a false choice. Thanks to computer simulations,
   real-life studies, and a bunch of math nerds, we now know of
   voting systems that are both simple and expressive.

   Personally, I'm leaning towards Score Voting. It's simple, very
   expressive, and already familiar to anyone who's seen Amazon's
   or Yelp's “five star” review system. But that's just my humble
   opinion. You could also make the case that Approval Voting is
   more practical, because it's even simpler, and would already
   work with existing voting machines! All you'd need to do is
   change the instructions from “vote for the candidate you like”
   to “vote for the candidates you like”.

   Or maybe I'm completely wrong about Instant Runoff Voting, and
   it's actually pretty okay. Heck, you could even go for Borda
   Count, as a hilarious prank.

   I won't claim to know which voting system is The Best™. I shall
   keep open this discussion, just as long as we have this
   discussion. For three reasons:

   1) If I claim one voting system is the best, end of story, all
   the social-choice-theory nerds will be on my butt, yelling, BUT
   NICKY WHAT ABOUT [29]QUADRATIC VOTE BUYING


   2) We still need to test these alternative voting systems with
   actual experience, not just annoying internet flame wars
   between IRV advocates and Score Voting advocates theory. All
   the more reason for small towns, local states, and nations like
   Canada to be pioneers, to bravely experiment!

   3) Keeping the discussion going is what democracy is.

   [30]A recent study found that in many Western countries – from
   Sweden to Australia to the United States – support for
   democracy has plummeted over the last several generations. In
   2011, almost a full quarter of young Americans said democracy
   was a "bad" or "very bad" way to run a country. And today, one
   in six Americans say it'd be "good" or "very good" to be under
   actual military rule.


   Our age of distrust goes a lot deeper than the technical
   details of a voting system. There isn't gonna be One Weird
   Trick to fix democracy. But as a first step, a low-hanging
   fruit, a way to show that, yes, you will make the system
   respond to the needs and wants and pains and hopes and dreams
   of your people – well, fixing our voting system's a good start
   as any.

   Because, this isn't just about trying to build a better ballot.

   This is about trying to build a better democracy.

   <3,
   ~ Nicky Case
