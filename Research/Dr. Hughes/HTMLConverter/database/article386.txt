   Last week's challenge:

   Take the four-letter men's names TODD, OMAR, DAVE and DREW. If
   you write them one under the other, they'll form a word square,
   spelling TODD, OMAR, DAVE and DREW reading down as well:
   TODD
   OMAR
   DAVE
   DREW

   Can you construct a word square consisting of five five-letter
   men's names? Any such square using relatively familiar men's
   names will count. I have an answer using four relatively common
   names and one less familiar one.

   Challenge answer: Winning answer
   ABRAM
   BLANE
   RANDY
   ANDRE
   MEYER

   Puzzle winner: Sixteen-year-old Marisa Schiller of Sandusky,
   Mich. She plays with her high school teacher, Kurt Wentzel, who
   assigns the puzzle to his students.

   Next week's challenge: This week's challenge comes from Mike
   Reiss, who's a writer/producer for The Simpsons. He's had a
   number of challenges on this program. Think of a two-word
   phrase you might see on a clothing label. Add two letters to
   the end of the first word, and one letter to the end of the
   second word. The result is the name of a famous writer. Who is
   it?
