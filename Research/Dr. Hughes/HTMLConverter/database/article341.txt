   Barred from research? UK chancellor Philip Hammond helps set
   policies that could determine whether EU nationals in the UK
   can still work there after Brexit.

   British universities fear losing large swathes of their
   research staff as the country faces up to Brexit, the split
   with the European Union. More than 31,000 academics at UK
   universities are non-British EU citizens, and so may lose their
   rights to live in the United Kingdom after Brexit.

   Last week, a UK parliamentary committee [35]published evidence
   from British institutions and funding agencies on the problem,
   as part of its inquiry into the effects of Brexit on the UK
   higher education system. It is "crucial that the long-term
   position of non-UK EU nationals is clarified as soon as
   possible", said Research Councils UK, the umbrella body for the
   country's seven main grants-funding agencies, in its written
   statement.


   Unless the government guarantees EU national academic staff the
   right to remain, it may not be easy for them to stay. Many have
   not lived in the United Kingdom long enough to be classified as
   permanent residents under current rules, and a large fraction
   do not earn enough on academic salaries to stay by gaining a
   ‘skilled worker’ visa. Nature runs through the numbers to
   illustrate the scale of the problem.
