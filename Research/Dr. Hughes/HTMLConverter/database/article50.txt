Squares Are Your Friends

   These simple tricks are all fine and well, but large numbers
   present a different challenge. For that, a physicist from
   [40]askamathematician.com says it’s a good idea is use the
   difference of squares (a square being a number multiplied by
   itself).

   “Take the two numbers you’re multiplying and think of them as
   their average, x, plus and minus the difference between each
   and their average, ±y,” he says. “These two numbers are
   squared, so rather than memorizing entire multiplication tables
   you only memorize squares.”

   It may seem like a daunting task, but memorizing all the
   squares from 1 to 20 isn’t as bad as it sounds. It’s just 20
   numbers, after all. Armed with this prior knowledge, you can
   perform some pretty incredible calculations.

   Here’s how it works, starting with a simple example. Let’s
   assume for a moment that we don’t know the answer to 10x4. The
   first step is to figure out the average number between these
   two numbers, which is 7 (i.e. 10-3=7, and 4+3=7). Next,
   determine the square of 7, which is 49. We now have a number
   that’s close, but not close enough. To get the correct answer,
   we have to square the difference between the average (in this
   case 3) providing us with 9. The last step is to do some simple
   subtraction, 49-9=40, and wouldn’t you know it you have the
   correct answer.

   That might seem like a roundabout way to calculate 10x4 (it
   is), but this same technique works for bigger numbers. Take
   15x11 for example. Once again, we have to find the average
   number between these two, which is 13. The square of 13 is 169.
   The square of the difference in the average (2) is 4. Finally,
   169-4=165, the correct answer.
