Connecting Through Numbers at the Joint Math Meetings

How a Random Experiment Found Order in Chaos

   By [46]Jessica Deters


   As mathematicians, numbers connect us; we all have an intimate
   connection with them. Consider picking a random number between
   1 and 10. As we cycle through the options, each carries so much
   meaning that none feel truly random. Not even computers can
   generate truly random numbers. The process they use, while
   pseudo-random, still has some semblance of order.

   I decided to ask the attendees of the Joint Math Meetings in
   Atlanta to pick a random number between 1 and 10 and provide
   their reasoning—an experiment of sorts on this idea of
   randomness. JMM can be a bit chaotic with over 6,000 attendees
   and can begin to feel like swimming through a sea of
   mathematicians and their work. I set out to not only discover
   the underlying reasoning to people’s random number picks but to
   unlock the power of the connectivity of numbers as well.

   Not surprisingly, asking mathematicians to pick a random number
   is a great way to start a conversation. Nearly every
   participant asked me about the results after providing their
   number and justification. Most JMM goers knew what the results
   should be yet wondered if this select group of mathematicians
   could beat the odds and produce a uniform distribution, which
   would indicate randomness.

   The people who participated in my experiment suspected that we
   would likely not generate a random distribution, as did I.
   Ideally, each number should have an equal likelihood of being
   picked, yielding a uniform distribution. But, the connection we
   each have with numbers, especially 1 through 10, would likely
   bring out some sort of pattern in people’s picks.

   We were right, and our connection with numbers won out over our
   knowledge of random distributions. Overwhelmingly, the most
   popular numbers were 3 and 7. However, everyone provided a
   different reason for picking their number—reasons that, as we
   might imagine, are far from random. Some picked their favorite
   number. Others settled for the 1 to 10 equivalent of their
   favorite number. For example, one person who favored 17 picked
   7. Another said 2, but that 22 would have been more favorable.
   Some did try to beat the odds and picked 9 or 10 because they
   figured others wouldn’t.

   Now, not all of the samples were taken independently. While
   some people were asked individually, the majority were asked in
   groups. This adds bias but highlights the influence of groups
   in randomness.

   I asked a group of seven over dinner at the National
   Association of Mathematics banquet to pick a number. Knowing
   that a truly random distribution should, in theory, produce one
   or maybe two of each number greatly influenced the results.
   Where the majority of answers in groups of one or two had been
   3 and 7, this group picked 3, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10. People
   even admitted to changing their choice because a number had
   already been taken.

   While this data would seem to suggest that people can generate
   random numbers, true randomness is a lack of predictability.
   The number choice of each group member became more and more
   predictable as we circled the table. As mathematicians, we are
   trained to see patterns, so there is seemingly no way to
   generate random numbers in a group, especially on such a small
   domain. We will always recognize the relationships between each
   number that is picked.

   Perhaps our ability to see and form relationships is more
   important than our inability to capture true randomness. We all
   see relationships between numbers and feel a connection to
   them, and we can use that shared love to connect with each
   other. Using a mutual love for numbers turned out to be a
   fantastic icebreaker and allowed me to approach and connect
   with countless mathematicians at JMM. Though, as humans, we are
   incapable of generating true randomness, we possess the
   superpower to see patterns, forge connections and find order in
   chaos.
