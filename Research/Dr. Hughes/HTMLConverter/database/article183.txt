The Mathematics of Electing a President

Discrepancies Between the Popular Vote and the Electoral College

   By [46]Nathan Ritchey


   In 1787, Article 2 of the [47]United States Constitution
   established the Executive Branch of government and the system
   of electing a president. Over the years, changes have been made
   to this article, but it continues to rely on the Electoral
   College to elect the president. In fact, Article 2, Section 1
   states that ”Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the
   Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors equal to
   the whole number of Senators and Representatives...” It also
   covers what to do in the event that no candidate receives the
   majority of Electoral Votes.


   Since the early days of the Constitution, many people have
   argued that extreme outcomes are possible using this method of
   electing a president. In his book How America Chooses Its
   Presidents, Alex Belenky lists sixteen extreme outcomes that
   can result during an election. The most common undesired
   outcome is when the elected president does not receive a
   majority in the popular vote. This has now occurred five times
   in U.S. history, twice since 2000. In each recent case,
   however, one could argue that the popular vote was nearly 50%
   for each major candidate. A reasonable question is just how
   wide the discrepancy between the popular vote and the Electoral
   College may be. In his 1961 article for The Mathematics
   Teacher, “The minimum fraction of the popular vote that can
   elect the President of the United States,” George Polya
   provided an inequality that can be used to show that the margin
   between the popular vote and the Electoral College can be quite
   large. For the 2016 election, this mathematics is recreated as
   follows.

   Let \(T\) be the total number of votes cast in an election,
   \(W\) be the number of votes earned by the winning candidate,
   and \(r_i\) be the number of representatives for state \(i\),
   where \(i = 1, ..., 54\)  (includes D.C., Nebraska split into
   three pieces, and Maine split into two pieces). We adjust
   \(r_i\) to accurately reflect the fact that Maine and Nebraska
   are not “winner take all” states. The number of Electoral
   College votes for each state is \(r_i + 2\), where
   \(i=1,...,54\). Also, let \(v_i\) be the number of popular
   votes cast in state \(i\), where \(i = 1, ..., 54\), and \(s\)
   be the number of states won by the winning candidate. We are
   interested in finding a lower bound on the quotient \(P =
   W/T\), which is the proportion of the popular vote won by the
   elected president.

   Suppose that a candidate wins the election by winning at least
   270 Electoral College votes in \(s\) states, reordered to
   reflect the states won. Then,

   \[(r_1 + 2) + (r_2 + 2) + \cdots + (r_s + 2) \ge 270,\]

   or

   \[r_1 + r_2 + \cdots + r_s \ge 270 - 2s. \tag1\]

   If we assume that, on average, the number of votes cast in a
   given state is proportional to its population, and therefore to
   its number of representatives, then \(T = 436K\). Therefore,
   \(K = T/436\).

   Now, to win the  \(r_i + 2\) votes for a given state \(i\), a
   candidate needs at least half of the votes cast plus one, or
   \(v_i/2 + 1\). This means that a winning candidate will have

   \[W \ge (\frac{v_1}{2}  + 1) + (\frac{v_2}{2} + 1) +\cdots+
   (\frac{v_s}{2} +1),\]

   \[W \ge (\frac{Kr_1}{2}  + 1) + (\frac{Kr_2}{2} + 1) +\cdots+
   (\frac{Kr_s}{2} +1),\]

   \[W \ge \frac{K}{2}(r_1 + r_2 +\cdots + r_s) + s.\]

   Dividing by \(T = 436K\) and using \((1)\) leads to

   \[\frac{W}{T} \ge \frac{270- 2s}{872} + \frac{s}{436K} \approx
   \frac{270 - 2s}{872},\]

   since \(K\) is a large number.

   In 2016, the eleven largest states had exactly 270 total
   Electoral College votes, which implies that those states could
   have determined the outcome of the election, provided they work
   in concert. Using the inequality above, this could have
   happened with  only 28.4% of the  popular vote.  In parallel,
   the forty-one states with the least number of Electoral College
   votes currently have a total  of 282 votes. In this case, if
   all the Electoral College votes for these states were awarded
   to a single candidate, then only 21.6% of the popular votes
   would be needed to elect a president in which nearly 78% of the
   voters may not ever vote for the elected president.

   Other people have used complicated mathematical algorithms to
   show that it is possible to reduce this threshold to nearly
   17%. It is also possible to skew the results even further by
   considering an election in which there are three or more viable
   candidates. This simple mathematics, however, illustrates that
   the Electoral College has characteristics that could lead to
   wide variations between the popular vote and the Electoral
   College. Given the results of the most recent presidential
   election, it will not be surprising if the Electoral College
   debate finds renewed energy.
