Mathematical Treasure: Kästner’s Foundations of Mathematics

   [308]Abraham Kästner (1719-1800) was a German mathematician
   noted for his textbook writing and encyclopedia compilation. He
   was a mentor of Euler and an active correspondent with Gauss.
   In his four-volume Mathematische Anfangsgründe, he attempted to
   use formalization to obtain a more precise mathematics. The
   title page for the second volume (1764) is shown above. In this
   volume, Kästner examined and questioned Euclid’s Fifth
   Postulate.


   The [309]Special Collections staff at the Linderman Library of
   Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is pleased to
   cooperate with the Mathematical Association of America to
   exhibit this and other items from the Library’s holdings in
   “Mathematical Treasures.” In particular, Convergence would like
   to thank Lois Fischer Black, Curator, Special Collections, and
   Ilhan Citak, Archives and Special Collections Librarian, for
   their kind assistance in helping to make this display
   possible. You may use these images in your classroom; all other
   uses require permission from the Special Collections staff,
