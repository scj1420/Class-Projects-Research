   Suppose you're a hotel manager and your hotel is full. That's
   great, of course, but there's always the temptation to squeeze
   in more guests. In real life, this might mean clearing out the
   broom cupboards and getting bad reviews on Trip Advisor, but in
   the world of maths it's no problem. As long as your hotel has
   infinitely many rooms, that is.

   Welcome to Hilbert's hotel!

   The idea goes back to the German mathematician [17]David
   Hilbert, who used the example of a hotel to demonstrate the
   counter-intuitive games you can play with infinity. Suppose
   that your hotel has infinitely many rooms, numbered 1, 2, 3,
   etc. All rooms are occupied, when a new guest arrives and asks
   to be put up. What do you do? It's easy. Ask the guest in room
   1 to move to room 2, the guest in room 2 to move into room 3,
   the guest in room 3 to move into room 4, and so on. If there
   were only finitely many rooms, the guest in the last room would
   have nowhere to go, but since there are infinitely many,
   everybody will find a new abode. You'll have to ask the guests
   to move simultaneously though, because if you ask them to move
   one after the other, the move might take an infinite amount of
   time, since infinitely many guests have to move.


   Using this trick you can actually accommodate any finite number
   of new guests. If $n$ new guests arrive, simply ask each
   existing guest to move to the room whose number is $n$ plus the
   number of their existing room. As an example, if there are $8$
   new guests, then the guest currently in room $10$ needs to move
   into room $10+8=18$ .

   But things get better still. Suppose an infinite number of new
   guests arrive, forming an orderly queue outside the hotel. In
   this case, ask each existing guest to move into the room whose
   number is twice the number of their current room. So, a guest
   staying in room $x$ moves to room $2x$ . After this manoeuvre
   only the even numbered rooms are occupied: rooms $2 = 2 \times
   1$ , $4 = 2 \times 2$ , $6 = 2 \times 3$ , and so on. The odd
   numbered rooms are all free, so you can put your first new
   guest into room 1, the second new guest into room 3, the third
   new guest into room 5, and so on. Everybody is happy.
