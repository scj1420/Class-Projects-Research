For Pi Day, key figures on math and education in the U.S.

   For almost 30 years, [34]math enthusiasts have been taking part
   in festivities on March 14 to honor an infinitely long number
   beginning with 3.14 – the ratio of a circle’s circumference to
   its diameter, otherwise known as pi.


   The first [35]official Pi Day was March 14, 1988, when
   physicist Larry Shaw led staff and visitors to San Francisco’s
   Exploratorium in a celebration of all things pi-related. Since
   then, it has been celebrated across the globe, with
   universities, conferences and [36]even pizzerias honoring the
   day.


   To mark Pi Day, here are four findings about math and education
   in the United States:

   [37][FT_17.03.13_piDay_skills.png] 1Americans rank math as one
   of the most important skills children need today to get ahead.
   In a 2014 [38]Pew Research Center survey, respondents were
   asked, “Regardless of whether or not you think these skills are
   good to have, which ones do you think are most important for
   children to get ahead in the world today?” Roughly eight-in-ten
   U.S. adults (79%) said math is one of the most important skills
   needed for youth to get ahead. That placed math on par with
   teamwork, but slightly lower than communication and reading.


   2Despite a recent dip in scores, U.S. students are more
   proficient in math than they were two decades ago. Four-in-ten
   fourth-graders and 33% of eighth-graders scored as “proficient”
   or “advanced” in math in 2015, according to a report released
   by the [39]National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)
   last fall. By comparison, only 13% of fourth-graders and 15% of
   eighth-graders [40]were rated at or above proficient in 1990.
   However, math scores have declined since the previous
   assessment in 2013, representing the [41]first drop in
   proficiency in 25 years.


   [42][FT_17.03.13_piDay_views_math.png] 3Math is popular among
   many students, with close to half describing it as one of their
   favorite subjects. Nearly half of eighth-grade students in the
   U.S. strongly agree (21%) or agree (26%) with the statement,
   “Math is one of my favorite subjects,” according to a Pew
   Research Center analysis of NAEP data. Even more students say
   they like math in general, with 64% of eighth-graders agreeing
   with this statement. Most students also describe math as
   something fun and a subject that they would not like to give
   up, though only 13% say this strongly describes their views.


   4More degrees are being awarded in mathematics and statistics.
   Of the 1.9 million [43]bachelor’s degrees awarded in the U.S.
   in 2014-2015, about 22,000 were earned in mathematics and
   statistics, according to data from the Department of
   Education’s Digest of Education Statistics. Although this
   represents a small sliver of degrees conferred overall, the
   number of degrees awarded in mathematics and statistics has
   risen nearly 30% since 2010-2011. By comparison, the number of
   overall degrees awarded grew 10% during this time.


   Why does it matter?

   Mathematics and statistics degrees are helpful in a wide range
   of jobs across government, research institutions and industries
   such as finance, insurance, biotechnology, computing and
   others. According to the [44]Bureau of Labor Statistics,
   employment of mathematicians in the U.S. is projected to
   [45]grow 21 percent from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the
   average for all occupations.
