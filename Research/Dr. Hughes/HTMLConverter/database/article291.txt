[15]Ten Years of Blog Comments


   By [16]Dan Meyer • September 27, 2016 • [17]16 Comments


   My blog turned ten years old this month so you’ll have to allow
   me a couple of indulgences.

   First, I set myself up with a new blog theme. (If you’re
   reading this via email or an RSS reader, you’ll have to click
   through to check it out.)

   Second, rather than reflect on ten years of my posts, I wanted
   to reflect on ten years of your comments. Over the last ten
   years, 4,600 people have written 20,000 comments on this blog,
   spanning two million words, [18]the very first of which was
   written by Chris Lehmann.


   My goal in blogging is to become curiouser and wiser with every
   post. Some of that happens in the post itself – through
   research, analysis, writing, etc – but so much of it happens in
   the comments.

   To offer one current example, I posted [19]Cathy Yenca’s method
   for teaching zero exponents last week. Forty comments later, my
   commenters offered two more methods for teaching them and
   helped me see [20]how all three methods are related. I’m
   curiouser and wiser now than I was forty comments ago. That
   happened because of all of you and I wanted to thank a few you
   of you personally.

   For example, here are the ten people who commented most often
   in every year that I’ve blogged.

   And these are the ten people whose comments have helped shape

   Most Featured Comments

   In 2011, I started to understand the gift of an active comments
   section, and how that gift needed encouragement and tending. So
   I began to add particularly helpful comments to the body of the
   post itself in a “Featured Comments” section. I made sure my
   commenters knew they had been promoted, hoping the endorsement
   would encourage them to continue bringing that kind of value.

   These are the twenty people whose comments have been featured
   two or more times since 2011.

   I sent a personal note of thanks to everybody mentioned in this
   post. Each person has made a significant donation of time,
   words, and insight to the project of making me curiouser and
   wiser.

   Whenever people ask me how I got wherever it is I am right now,
   I always tell them about you, about how my ideas and thinking
   developed twice as fast as they had any right to. And I
   attribute that difference entirely to your time, words, and
   insight.

   Wherever it is I’m going, I intend to get there exactly the
   same way.

     Congrats and well done! I think I remember that day back in
     2007. I got to work, threw in a Nelly CD, fired up my
     Netscape browser and made my comment. Incidentally I drove
     the same Toyota Camry that I still drive to work. Later on I
     think I went home and watched Lost and then read about
