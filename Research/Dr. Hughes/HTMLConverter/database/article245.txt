   Having discussed differentiation of complex mappings in the
   preceding notes, we now turn to the integration of complex
   maps. We first briefly review the situation of integration of
   (suitably regular) real functions {f: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf
   R}} of one variable. Actually there are three closely related
   concepts of integration that arise in this setting:
       which is usually interpreted as the [25]Riemann integral
       (or equivalently, the [26]Darboux integral), which can be
       defined as the limit (if it exists) of the [27]Riemann sums
       \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^n f(x_j^*) (x_j - x_{j-1}) \ \ \ \
                                  \ (1)
       where {a = x_0 < x_1 < \dots < x_n = b} is some
       [28]partition of {[a,b]} , {x_j^*} is an element of the
       interval {[x_{j-1},x_j]} , and the limit is taken as the
       maximum mesh size {\max_{1 \leq j \leq n} |x_j - x_{j-1}|}
       goes to zero. It is convenient to adopt the convention that
       {\int_b^a f(x)\ dx := - \int_a^b f(x)\ dx} for {a < b} ;
       alternatively one can interpret {\int_b^a f(x)\ dx} as the
       limit of the Riemann sums [29](1), where now the (reversed)
       partition {b = x_0 > x_1 > \dots > x_n = a} goes leftwards
       from {b} to {a} , rather than rightwards from {a} to {b} .

       , usually interpreted as the [30]Lebesgue integral. The
       precise definition of this integral is a little complicated
       (see e.g. [31]this previous post), but roughly speaking the
       idea is to approximate {f} by simple functions
       {\sum_{i=1}^n c_i 1_{E_i}} for some coefficients {c_i \in
       {\bf R}} and sets {E_i \subset [a,b]} , and then
       approximate the integral {\int_{[a,b]} f(x)\ dx} by the
       quantities {\sum_{i=1}^n c_i m(E_i)} , where {E_i} is the
       [32]Lebesgue measure of {E_i} . In contrast to the signed
       definite integral, no orientation is imposed or used on the
       underlying domain of integration, which is viewed as an
       “undirected” set {[a,b]} .

       f(x)\ dx} , defined as any function {F: [a,b] \rightarrow
       {\bf R}} whose derivative {F'} exists and is equal to {f}
       on {[a,b]} . Famously, the antiderivative is only defined
       up to the addition of an arbitrary constant {C} , thus for
       instance {\int x\ dx = \frac{1}{2} x^2 + C} .


   There are some other variants of the above integrals (e.g. the
   [34]Henstock-Kurzweil integral, discussed for instance in
   [35]this previous post), which can handle slightly different
   classes of functions and have slightly different properties
   than the standard integrals listed here, but we will not need
   to discuss such alternative integrals in this course (with the
   exception of some [36]improper and [37]principal value
   integrals, which we will encounter in later notes).


   The above three notions of integration are closely related to
   each other. For instance, if {f: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf R}} is
   a Riemann integrable function, then the signed definite
   integral and unsigned definite integral coincide (when the
   former is oriented correctly), thus

       \displaystyle \int_a^b f(x)\ dx = \int_{[a,b]} f(x)\ dx

   and

      \displaystyle \int_b^a f(x)\ dx = -\int_{[a,b]} f(x)\ dx

   If {f: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf R}} is continuous, then by the
   fundamental theorem of calculus, it possesses an antiderivative
   {F = \int f(x)\ dx} , which is well defined up to an additive
   constant {C} , and

            \displaystyle \int_c^d f(x)\ dx = F(d) - F(c)

   for any {c,d \in [a,b]} , thus for instance {\int_a^b F(x)\ dx
   = F(b) - F(a)} and {\int_b^a F(x)\ dx = F(a) - F(b)} .

   All three of the above integration concepts have analogues in
   complex analysis. By far the most important notion will be the
   complex analogue of the signed definite integral, namely the
   [38]contour integral {\int_\gamma f(z)\ dz} , in which the
   directed line segment from one real number {a} to another {b}
   is now replaced by a type of curve in the complex plane known
   as a contour. The contour integral can be viewed as the special
   case of the more general [39]line integral {\int_\gamma f(z) dx

   analysis. There are also analogues of the Lebesgue integral,
   namely the arclength measure integrals {\int_\gamma f(z)\ |dz|}
   and the area integrals {\int_\Omega f(x+iy)\ dx dy} , but these
   play only an auxiliary role in the subject. Finally, we still
   have the notion of an antiderivative {F(z)} (also known as a
   primitive) of a complex function {f(z)} .

   As it turns out, the fundamental theorem of calculus continues
   to hold in the complex plane: under suitable regularity
   assumptions on a complex function {f} and a primitive {F} of
   that function, one has

        \displaystyle \int_\gamma f(z)\ dz = F(z_1) - F(z_0)

   whenever {\gamma} is a contour from {z_0} to {z_1} that lies in
   the domain of {f} . In particular, functions {f} that possess a
   primitive must be [40]conservative in the sense that
   {\int_\gamma f(z)\ dz = 0} for any closed contour. This
   property of being conservative is not typical, in that “most”
   functions {f} will not be conservative. However, there is a
   remarkable and far-reaching theorem, the [41]Cauchy integral
   theorem (also known as the Cauchy-Goursat theorem), which
   asserts that any holomorphic function is conservative, so long
   as the domain is [42]simply connected (or if one restricts
   attention to [43]contractible closed contours). We will explore
   this theorem and several of its consequences the next set of
   notes.


               — 1. Integration along a contour —

   The notion of a curve is a very intuitive one. However, the
   precise mathematical definition of what a curve actually is
   depends a little bit on what type of mathematics one wishes to
   do. If one is mostly interested in topology, then a good notion
   is that of a [44]continuous (parameterised) curve. If one wants
   to do analysis in somewhat irregular domains, it is convenient
   to restrict the notion of curve somewhat, to the
   [45]rectifiable curves. If one is doing analysis in “nice”
   domains (such as the complex plane {{\bf C}} , a half-plane, a
   punctured plane, a disk, or an annulus), then it is convenient
   to restrict the notion further, to the piecewise smooth curves,
   also known as [46]contours. If one wished to get to the main
   theorems of complex analysis as quickly as possible, then one
   would restrict attention only to contours and skip much of this
   section; however we shall take a more leisurely approach here,
   discussing curves and rectifiable curves as well, as these
   concepts are also useful outside of complex analysis. In fact,
   we will structure our notes so that most of our theorems in
   fact apply to rectifiable curves (and several will in fact be
   applicable to arbitrary continuous curves).


   We begin by defining the notion of a continuous curve.

     Definition 1 (Continuous curves) A continuous parameterised
     curve, or curve for short, is a continuous map {\gamma:
     [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf C}} from a compact interval {[a,b]
     \subset {\bf R}} to the complex plane {{\bf C}} . We call
     the curve trivial if {a=b} , and non-trivial otherwise. We
     refer to the complex numbers {\gamma(a), \gamma(b)} as the
     initial point and terminal point (or final point) of the
     curve respectively, and refer to these two points
     collectively as the endpoints of the curve. We say that the
     curve is closed if {\gamma(a) = \gamma(b)} . We say that the
     curve is simple if one has {\gamma(t) \neq \gamma(t')} for
     any distinct {t,t' \in [a,b]} , with the possible exception
     of the endpoint cases {t=a, t'=b} or {t=b, t'=a} (thus we
     allow closed curves to be simple). We refer to the subset
     {\gamma([a,b]) := \{ \gamma(t): t \in [a,b]\}} of the
     complex plane as the image of the curve.

   We caution that the term “closed” here does not refer to the
   topological notion of closure: for any curve {\gamma} (closed
   or otherwise), the image {\gamma([a,b])} of the curve, being
   the continuous image of a compact set, is necessarily a compact
   subset of {{\bf C}} and is thus always topologically closed.

   A basic example of a curve is the directed line segment
   {\gamma_{z_1 \rightarrow z_2}: [0,1] \rightarrow {\bf C}} from
   one complex point {z_1} to another {z_2} , defined by

   \displaystyle \gamma_{z_1 \rightarrow z_2}(t) := (1-t) z_1 + t
                                 z_2

   for {0 \leq t \leq 1} . (Thus, contrary to the informal English
   meaning of the terms, we consider line segments to be examples
   of curves, despite having zero curvature; in general, it is
   convenient in mathematics to admit such “degenerate” objects
   into one’s definitions, in order to obtain good closure
   properties for these objects, and to maximise the generality of
   the definition.) If {z_1 \neq z_2} , this is a simple curve,
   while for {z_1 = z_2} it is (a rather degenerate, but still
   non-trivial) closed curve. Another important example of a curve
   is the anti-clockwise circle {\gamma_{z_0,r,\circlearrowleft}:
   [0,2\pi] \rightarrow {\bf C}} of some radius {r>0} around a
   complex centre {z_0 \in {\bf C}} , defined by

   \displaystyle \gamma_{z_0,r,\circlearrowleft}(\theta) := z_0 +
                    r e^{i\theta}. \ \ \ \ \ (2)

   This is a simple closed non-trivial curve. If we extended the
   domain here from {[0,2\pi]} to (say) {[0,4\pi]} , the curve
   would remain closed, but would no longer be simple (every point
   in the image is now traversed twice by the curve).

   Note that it is technically possible for two distinct curves to
   have the same image. For instance, the anti-clockwise circle
   {\tilde \gamma_{z_0,r,\circlearrowleft}: [0,1] \rightarrow {\bf
   C}} of some radius {r>0} around a complex centre {z_0 \in {\bf
   C}} defined by

   \displaystyle \tilde \gamma_{z_0,r,\circlearrowleft}(\theta) :=
                      z_0 + r e^{2\pi i \theta}

   traverses the same image as the previous curve [47](2), but is
   considered a distinct curve from
   {\gamma_{z_0,r,\circlearrowleft}} . Nevertheless the two curves
   are closely related to each other, and we formalise this as
   follows. We say that one curve {\gamma_2: [a_2,b_2] \rightarrow
   {\bf C}} is a continuous reparameterisation of another
   {\gamma_1: [a_1, b_1] \rightarrow {\bf C}} , if there is a
   [48]homeomorphism {\phi: [a_1,b_1] \rightarrow [a_2,b_2]} (that
   is to say, a continuous invertible map whose inverse
   {\phi^{-1}: [a_2,b_2] \rightarrow [a_1,b_1]} is also
   continuous) which is endpoint preserving (i.e., {\phi(a_1)=a_2}
   and {\phi(b_1)=b_2} ) such that {\gamma_2(\phi(t)) =
   \gamma_1(t)} for all {t \in [a_1,b_1]} (that is to say,
   {\gamma_1 = \gamma_2 \circ \phi} , or equivalently {\gamma_2 =
   \gamma_1 \circ \phi^{-1}} ), in which case we write {\gamma_1
   \equiv \gamma_2} . Thus for instance
   {\gamma_{z_0,r,\circlearrowleft} \equiv \tilde
   \gamma_{z_0,r,\circlearrowleft}} . The relation of being a
   continuous reparameterisation is an [49]equivalence relation,
   so one can talk about the notion of a curve “up to continuous
   reparameterisation”, by which we mean an [50]equivalence class
   of a curve under this relation. Thus for instance the image of
   a curve, as well as its initial point and end point, are well
   defined up to continuous reparameterisation, since if {\gamma_1
   \equiv \gamma_2} then {\gamma_1} and {\gamma_2} have the same
   image, the same initial point, and the same terminal point. It
   is common to depict an equivalence class of a curve {\gamma}
   graphically, by drawing its image together with an arrow
   depicting the direction of motion from the initial point to its
   endpoint. (In the case of a non-simple curve, one may need
   multiple arrows in order to clarify the direction of motion,
   and also the possible multiplicity of the curve.)


     Exercise 2 Let {\phi: [a_1,b_1] \rightarrow [a_2,b_2]} be a
     continuous invertible map.
       is continuous, so that {\phi} is a homeomorphism. (Hint:
       use the fact that a continuous image of a compact set is
       compact, and that a subset of an interval is topologically
       closed if and only if it is compact.)
       that {\phi} is monotone increasing. (Hint: use the
       intermediate value theorem.)
       [a_2,b_2]} is a continuous monotone increasing map with
       {\psi(a_1) = a_2} and {\psi(b_1) = b_2} , show that {\psi}
       is a homeomorphism.

   It will be important for us that we do not allow
   reparameterisations to reverse the endpoints. For instance, if
   {z_1,z_2} are distinct points in the complex plane, the
   directed line segment {\gamma_{z_1 \rightarrow z_2}} is not a
   reparameterisation of the directed line segment {\gamma_{z_2
   \rightarrow z_1}} since they do not have the same initial point
   (or same terminal point); the map {t \mapsto 1-t} is a
   homeomorphism from {[0,1]} to {[0,1]} but it does not preserve
   the initial point or the terminal point. In general, given a
   curve {\gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf C}} , we define its
   reversal {-\gamma: [-b,-a] \rightarrow {\bf C}} to be the curve
   {(-\gamma)(t) := \gamma(-t)} , thus for instance {\gamma_{z_2
   \rightarrow z_1}} is (up to reparameterisation) the reversal of
   {\gamma_{z_1 \rightarrow z_2}} , thus

   \displaystyle \gamma_{z_2 \rightarrow z_1} \equiv - \gamma_{z_1
                          \rightarrow z_2}.

   Another basic operation on curves is that of concatenation.
   Suppose we have two curves {\gamma_1: [a_1,b_1] \rightarrow
   {\bf C}} and {\gamma_2: [a_2,b_2] \rightarrow {\bf C}} with the
   property that the terminal point {\gamma_1(b_1)} of {\gamma_1}
   equals the initial point {\gamma_2(a_2)} of {\gamma_2} . We can
   reparameterise {\gamma_2} by translation to {\tilde \gamma_2:
   [b_1, b_2+b_1-a_2] \rightarrow {\bf C}} , defined by {\tilde
   \gamma_2(t) := \gamma_2(t - b_1 + a_2)} . We then define the
   concatenation or sum {\gamma_1 + \gamma_2: [a_1, b_2+b_1-a_2]
   \rightarrow {\bf C}} by setting

        \displaystyle (\gamma_1 + \gamma_2)(t) := \gamma_1(t)

   for {a_1 \leq t \leq b_1} and

    \displaystyle (\gamma_1 + \gamma_2)(t) := \tilde \gamma_2(t)

   for {b_1 \leq t \leq b_2+b_1-a_2} (note that these two
   definitions agree on their common domain point {t=b_1} by the
   hypothesis {\gamma_1(b_1) = \gamma_2(a_2)} . It is easy to see
   that this concatenation {\gamma_1+\gamma_2} is still a
   continuous curve. The reader at this point is encouraged to
   draw a picture to understand what the concatenation operation
   is doing; it is much simpler to grasp it visually than the
   above lengthy definition may suggest. If the terminal point of
   {\gamma_1} does not equal the initial point of {\gamma_2} , we
   leave the sum {\gamma_1+\gamma_2} undefined. (One can define
   more general spaces than the space of curves in which such an
   addition can make sense, such as the space of [51]{1} -currents
   if one assumes some rectifiability on the curves, or the space
   of [52]{1} -chains, but we will not need such general spaces
   here.)


   Concatenation is well behaved with respect to equivalence and
   reversal:

     Exercise 3 Let {\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \gamma_3, \tilde
     \gamma_1, \tilde \gamma_2} be continuous curves. Suppose
     that the terminal point of {\gamma_1} equals the initial
     point of {\gamma_2} , and the terminal point of {\gamma_2}
     equals the initial point of {\gamma_3} .
       {\gamma_1 \equiv \tilde \gamma_1} and {\gamma_2 \equiv
       \tilde \gamma_2} , show that {\gamma_1+\gamma_2 \equiv
       \tilde \gamma_1 + \tilde \gamma_2} and {-\gamma_1 \equiv -
       \tilde \gamma_1} .
       {(\gamma_1+\gamma_2)+\gamma_3 = \gamma_1 + (\gamma_2 +
       \gamma_3)} . In particular, we certainly have
       {(\gamma_1+\gamma_2)+\gamma_3 \equiv \gamma_1 + (\gamma_2 +
       \gamma_3)}
       {-(\gamma_1+\gamma_2) \equiv (-\gamma_2) + (-\gamma_1)} .
       {\gamma_1+\gamma_2} and {\gamma_2+\gamma_1} are both
       well-defined, but not equivalent to each other.
       terminal points of {\gamma_1} respectively, and {\delta_z:
       [0,0] \rightarrow {\bf C}} is the trivial curve {\delta_z:
       0 \rightarrow z} defined for any {z \in {\bf C}} , show
       that {\delta_{z_1} + \gamma_1 \equiv \gamma_1} and
       {\gamma_1 + \delta_{z_2} \equiv \gamma_1} .
       will however be [53]homologous to a trivial curve, as we
       will discuss in later notes.)


     Remark 4 The above exercise allows one to view the space of
     curves up to equivalence as a [54]category, with the points
     in the complex plane being the objects of the category, and
     each equivalence class of curves being a single [55]morphism
     from the initial point to the terminal point (and with the
     equivalence class of trivial curves being the identity
     morphisms). This point of view can be useful in topology,
     particularly when relating to concepts such as the
     [56]fundamental group (and fundamental groupoid),
     [57]monodromy, and [58]holonomy. However, we will not need
     to use any advanced category-theoretic concepts in this
     course.


     Exercise 5 Let {z_0 \in {\bf C}} and {r>0} . For any integer
     {m} , let {\gamma_m: [0,2\pi] \rightarrow {\bf C}} denote
     the curve

            \displaystyle \gamma_m(t) := z_0 + r e^{i m t}

     (thus for instance {\gamma_1 =
     \gamma_{z_0,r,\circlearrowright}} ).
       \equiv \gamma_{-m}} .
       have {\gamma_m + \gamma_{m'} \equiv \gamma_{m+m'}} . What
       happens for other values of {m,m'} ?
       \not \equiv \gamma_{m'}} .

   Given a sequence of complex numbers {z_0,z_1,\dots,z_n} , we
   define the polygonal path {\gamma_{z_0 \rightarrow z_1
   \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow z_n}} traversing these numbers in
   order to be the curve

     \displaystyle \gamma_{z_0 \rightarrow z_1 \rightarrow \dots
   \rightarrow z_n} := \gamma_{z_0 \rightarrow z_1} + \gamma_{z_1
    \rightarrow z_2} + \dots + \gamma_{z_{n-1} \rightarrow z_n}.

   This is well-defined thanks to Exercise [59]3(ii) (actually all
   we really need in applications is being well-defined up to
   equivalence). Thus for instance {\gamma_{z_0 \rightarrow z_1
   \rightarrow z_2 \rightarrow z_0}} would traverse a closed
   triangular path connecting {z_0} , {z_1} , and {z_2} (this path
   may end up being non-simple if the points {z_0,z_1,z_2} are
   collinear).

   In order to do analysis, we need to restrict our attention to
   those curves which are [60]rectifiable:


     Definition 6 Let {\gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf C}} be a
     curve. The [61]arc length {|\gamma|} of the curve is defined
     to be the supremum of the quantities


       \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^n |\gamma(t_{j+1})-\gamma(t_j)|

     where {n} ranges over the natural numbers and {a = t_0 < t_1
     < \dots < t_n = b} ranges over the [62]partitions of {[a,b]}
     . We say that the curve {\gamma} is rectifiable if its arc
     length is finite.


   The concept is best understood visually: a curve is rectifiable
   if there is some finite bound on the length of polygonal paths
   one can form while traversing the curve in order. From Exercise
   [63]2 we see that equivalent curves have the same arclength, so
   the concepts of arclength and rectifiability are well defined
   for curves that are only given up to continuous
   reparameterisation.

     Exercise 7 Let {\gamma_1,\gamma_2} be curves, with the
     terminal point of {\gamma_1} equal to the initial point of
     {\gamma_2} . Show that

     \displaystyle |\gamma_1+\gamma_2| = |\gamma_1| + |\gamma_2|.

     In particular, {\gamma_1+\gamma_2} is rectifiable if and
     only if {\gamma_1, \gamma_2} are both individually
     rectifiable.

   It is not immediately obvious that any reasonable curve (e.g.
   the line segments {\gamma_{z_1 \rightarrow z_2}} or the circles
   {\gamma_{z_0,r,\circlearrowleft}} ) are rectifiable. To verify
   this, we need two preliminary results.

     Lemma 8 (Triangle inequality) Let {f: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf
     C}} be a continuous function. Then

     \displaystyle |\int_a^b f(t)\ dt| \leq \int_a^b |f(t)|\ dt.

     Here we interpret {\int_a^b f(t)\ dt} as the Riemann
     integral (or equivalently, {\int_a^b f(t)\ dt = \int_a^b
     \mathrm{Re} f(t)\ dt + i \int_a^b \mathrm{Im} f(t)\ dt} ).

   Proof: We first attempt to prove this inequality by considering
   the real and imaginary parts separately. From the real-valued
   triangle inequality (and basic properties of the Riemann
   integral) we have

     \displaystyle | \mathrm{Re} \int_a^b f(t)\ dt | = |\int_a^b
                       \mathrm{Re} f(t)\ dt |

         \displaystyle \leq \int_a^b |\mathrm{Re} f(t)|\ dt

               \displaystyle \leq \int_a^b |f(t)|\ dt

   and similarly

     \displaystyle |\mathrm{Im} \int_a^b f(t)\ dt| \leq \int_a^b
                             |f(t)|\ dt

   but these two bounds only yield the weaker estimate

      \displaystyle |\int_a^b f(t)\ dt| \leq \sqrt{2} \int_a^b
                             |f(t)|\ dt.

   To eliminate this {\sqrt{2}} loss we can [64]amplify the above
   argument by exploiting phase rotation. For any real {\theta} ,
   we can repeat the above arguments (using the complex linearity
   of the Riemann integral, which is easily verified) to give


    \displaystyle | \mathrm{Re} e^{i\theta} \int_a^b f(t)\ dt | =
            |\int_a^b \mathrm{Re} e^{i\theta} f(t)\ dt |

   \displaystyle \leq \int_a^b |\mathrm{Re} e^{i\theta} f(t)|\ dt

               \displaystyle \leq \int_a^b |f(t)|\ dt.

   But we have {|z| = \sup_\theta \mathrm{Re} e^{i\theta} z} for
   any complex number {z} , so taking the supremum of both sides
   in {\theta} we obtain the claim. \Box

     Exercise 9 Let {a \leq b} be real numbers. Show that the
     interval {[a,b]} is [65]topologically connected, that is to
     say the only two subsets of {[a,b]} that are both open and
     closed [66]relative to {[a,b]} are the empty set and all of
     {[a,b]} . (Hint: if {E} is a non-empty set that is both open
     and closed in {[a,b]} and contains {a} , consider the
     supremum of all {T_* \in [a,b]} such that {[a,T_*] \subset
     E} .)


   Next, we say that a non-trivial curve {\gamma: [a,b]
   \rightarrow {\bf C}} is continuously differentiable if the
   derivative

     \displaystyle \gamma'(t) := \lim_{t' \rightarrow t: t' \in
     [a,b] \backslash \{t\}} \frac{\gamma(t') - \gamma(t)}{t'-t}

   exists and is continuous for all {t \in [a,b]} (note that we
   are only taking right-derivatives at {t=a} and left-derivatives
   at {t=b} ).

     Proposition 10 (Arclength formula) If {\gamma: [a,b]
     \rightarrow {\bf C}} is a continuously differentiable curve,
     then it is rectifiable, and

         \displaystyle |\gamma| = \int_a^b |\gamma'(t)|\ dt.

   Proof: We first prove the upper bound

   \displaystyle |\gamma| \leq \int_a^b |\gamma'(t)|\ dt \ \ \ \ \
                                 (3)

   which in particular implies the rectifiability of {\gamma}
   since the right-hand side of [67](3) is finite. Let {a = t_0 <
   \dots < t_n = b} be any partition of {[a,b]} . By the
   fundamental theorem of calculus (applied to the real and
   imaginary parts of {\gamma} ) we have

            \displaystyle \gamma(t_j) - \gamma(t_{j-1}) =
                 \int_{t_{j-1}}^{t_j} \gamma'(t)\ dt

   for any {1 \leq i \leq n} , and hence by Lemma [68]8 we have

         \displaystyle |\gamma(t_j) - \gamma(t_{j-1})| \leq
               \int_{t_{j-1}}^{t_j} |\gamma'(t)|\ dt.

   Summing in {j} we obtain

   \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^n |\gamma(t_i) - \gamma(t_{i-1})| \leq
                      \int_a^b |\gamma'(t)|\ dt

   and taking suprema over all partitions we obtain [69](3).

   Now we need to show the matching lower bound. Let
   {\varepsilon>0} be a small quantity, and for any {a \leq T \leq
   b} , let {\gamma_{[a,T]}: [a,T] \rightarrow {\bf C}} denote the
   restriction of {\gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf C}} to {[a,T]} .
   We will show the bound

   \displaystyle |\gamma_{[a,T]}| \geq \int_a^T |\gamma'(t)|\ dt -
                   \varepsilon (T-a) \ \ \ \ \ (4)

   for all {a \leq T \leq b} ; specialising to {T=b} and then
   sending {\varepsilon \rightarrow 0} will give the claim.

   It remains to prove [70](4) for a given choice of {\varepsilon}
   . We will use a continuous version of induction known as the
   [71]continuity method, which exploits Exercise [72]9.


   Let {\Omega_\varepsilon \subset [a,b]} denote the set of {T_*
   \in [a,b]} such that [73](4) holds for all {a \leq T \leq T_*}
   . It is clear (using Exercise [74]7, which implies that
   {|\gamma_{[a,T]}|} is an increasing function of {T} ) that this
   set {\Omega_\varepsilon} is topologically closed, and also
   contains the left endpoint {a} of {[a,b]} . If {T_* \in
   \Omega_\varepsilon} and {T_* < b} , then from the
   differentiability of {\gamma} at {T_*} , we have some interval
   {[T_*, T_*+\delta] \subset [a,b]} such that

       \displaystyle |\frac{\gamma(T) - \gamma(T_*)}{T-T_*} -
                  \gamma'(T_*)| \leq \varepsilon/2

   for all {T \in [T_*, T_*+\delta]} . Rearranging this using the
   triangle inequality, we have

     \displaystyle |\gamma(T) - \gamma(T_*)| \geq |\gamma'(T_*)|
              (T-T_*) - \frac{\varepsilon}{2} (T-T_*).

   Also, from the continuity of {|\gamma'|} we have

   \displaystyle \int_{T_*}^T |\gamma'(t)\ dt| \leq |\gamma'(T_*)|
               (T-T_*) + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} (t-T_*)

   for all {T \in [T_*, T_*+\delta]} , if {\delta} is small
   enough. We conclude that

      \displaystyle |\gamma(T) - \gamma(T_*)| \geq \int_{T_*}^T
                \gamma'(t)\ dt - \varepsilon (T-T_*),

   and hence

   \displaystyle |\gamma_{[T_*,T]}| \geq \int_{T_*}^T \gamma'(t)\
                      dt - \varepsilon (T-T_*)

   where {\gamma_{[T_*,T]}: [T_*,T] \rightarrow {\bf C}} is the
   restriction of {\gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf C}} to {[T_*,T]}
   . Adding this to the {T=T_*} case of [75](4) using [76](7) we
   conclude that [77](4) also holds for all {T \in
   [T_*,T_*+\delta]} . From this we see that {\Omega_\varepsilon}
   is (relatively) open in {[a,b]} ; from the connectedness of
   {[a,b]} we conclude that {\Omega_\varepsilon = [a,b]} , and we
   are done. \Box

   It is now easy to verify that the line segment {\gamma_{z_1
   \rightarrow z_2}} is rectifiable with arclength {|z_2-z_1|} ,
   and that the circle {\gamma_{z_0,r,\circlearrowleft}} is
   rectifiable with arclength {2\pi r} , exactly as one would
   expect from elementary geometry. Finally, from Lemma [78]7, a
   polygonal path {\gamma_{z_0 \rightarrow z_1 \rightarrow \dots
   \rightarrow z_n}} will be rectifiable with arclength {|z_0-z_1|

     Exercise 11 Show that the curve {\gamma: [0,1] \rightarrow
     {\bf C}} defined by setting {\gamma(t) := t + i t
     \sin(\frac{1}{t})} for {0 < t \leq 1} and {\gamma(0) := 0}
     is continuous but not rectifiable. (Hint: it is not
     necessary to compute the arclength precisely; a lower bound
     that goes to infinity will suffice. Graph the curve to
     discover some convenient partitions with which to generate
     such lower bounds. Alternatively, one can apply the
     arclength formula to some subcurves of {\gamma} .)

     Exercise 12 (This exercise presumes familiarity with
     Lebesgue measure.) Show that the image of a [79]rectifable
     curve is necessarily of measure zero in the complex plane.
     (In particular, [80]space-filling curves such as the
     [81]Peano curve or the [82]Hilbert curve cannot be
     rectifiable.)


     Remark 13 As the above exercise suggests, many [83]fractal
     curves will fail to be rectifiable; for instance the
     [84]Koch snowflake is a famous example of an unrectifiable
     curve. (The situation is clarified once one develops the
     theory of [85]Hausdorff dimension, as is done for instance
     in [86]this previous post: any curve of Hausdorff dimension
     strictly greater than one will be unrectifiable.)


   Much as continuous functions {f: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf R}} on
   an interval may be integrated by taking limits of Riemann sums,
   we may also integrate continuous functions {f: \gamma([a,b])
   \rightarrow {\bf C}} on the image of a rectifiable curve
   {\gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf C}} :

     Proposition 14 (Integration in rectifiable curves) Let
     {\gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf C}} be a rectifiable curve,
     and let {f: \gamma([a,b]) \rightarrow {\bf C}} be a
     continuous function on the image {\gamma([a,b])} of {\gamma}
     . Then the “Riemann sums”

      \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^n f(\gamma(t^*_j)) (\gamma(t_j) -
                   \gamma(t_{j-1})), \ \ \ \ \ (5)

     where {a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b} ranges over the partitions
     of {[a,b]} , and for each {1 \leq j \leq n} , {t^*_j} is an
     element of {[t_{j-1},t_j]} , converge as the maximum mesh
     size {\max_{1 \leq j \leq n} |t_j - t_{j-1}|} goes to zero
     to some complex limit, which we will denote as {\int_\gamma
     f(z)\ dz} . In other words, for every {\varepsilon>0} there
     exists a {\delta} such that

     \displaystyle |\sum_{j=1}^n f(\gamma(t^*_j)) (\gamma(t_j) -
      \gamma(t_{j-1})) - \int_\gamma f(z)\ dz| \leq \varepsilon

     whenever {\max_{1 \leq j \leq n} |t_j - t_{j-1}| \leq
     \delta} .

   Proof: In real analysis courses, one often uses the order
   properties of the real line to replace the rather complicated
   looking Riemann sums with the simpler [87]Darboux sums, en
   route to proving the real-variable analogue of the above
   proposition. However, in our complex setting the ordering of
   the real line is not available, so we will tackle the Riemann
   sums directly rather than try to compare them with Darboux
   sums.


   It suffices to prove that the “Riemann sums” [88](5) are a
   Cauchy sequence, in the sense that the difference

     \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^n f(\gamma(t^*_j)) (\gamma(t_j) -
   \gamma(t_{j-1})) - \sum_{k=1}^m f(\gamma(s^*_k)) (\gamma(s_k) -
                          \gamma(s_{k-1}))

   between two sums of the form [89](5) is smaller than any
   specified {\varepsilon>0} if the maximum mesh sizes of the two
   partitions {a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b} and {a = s_0 < \dots <
   s_m = b} are both small enough. From the triangle inequality,
   and from the fact that any two partitions have a common
   refinement, it suffices to prove this under the additional
   assumption that the second partition {a = s_0 < \dots < s_m =
   b} is a refinement of {a = t_0 < \dots < t_n = b} . This means
   that there is an increasing sequence {0 = m_0 < m_1 < \dots <
   m_n = b} of natural numbers such that {s_{m_j} = t_j} for
   {j=0,\dots,n} . In that case, the above difference may be
   rearranged as

                   \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^n E_j

   where

        \displaystyle E_j := f(\gamma(t^*_j)) (\gamma(t_j) -
    \gamma(t_{j-1})) - \sum_{k=m_{j-1}+1}^{m_j} f(\gamma(s^*_k))
                  (\gamma(s_k) - \gamma(s_{k-1})).

   By telescoping series, we may rearrange {E_j} further as

   \displaystyle E_j := \sum_{k=m_{j-1}+1}^{m_j} (f(\gamma(t^*_j))
        - f(\gamma(s^*_k))) (\gamma(s_k) - \gamma(s_{k-1})).

   As {\gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf C}} is continuous and
   {[a,b]} is compact, {\gamma} is [90]uniformly continuous. In
   particular, if the maximum mesh sizes are small enough, we have


      \displaystyle |f(\gamma(t^*_j)) - f(\gamma(s^*_k))| \leq
                             \varepsilon

   for all {1 \leq j \leq n} and {m_{j-1} \leq k \leq m_j} . From
   the triangle inequality we conclude that

    \displaystyle |E_j| \leq \varepsilon \sum_{k=m_{j-1}+1}^{m_j}
                   |\gamma(s_k) - \gamma(s_{k-1})|

   and hence on summing in {j} and using the triangle inequality,
   we can bound

     \displaystyle |\sum_{j=1}^n E_j| \leq \varepsilon |\gamma|.

   Since {|\gamma|} is finite, and {\varepsilon} can be made
   arbitrarily small, we obtain the required Cauchy sequence
   property. \Box

   One cannot simply omit the rectifiability hypothesis from the
   above proposition:

     Exercise 15 Give an example of a curve {\gamma: [a,b]
     \rightarrow {\bf C}} such that the Riemann sums

       \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^n \gamma(t^*_j) (\gamma(t_j) -
                           \gamma(t_{j-1}))

     fail to converge to a limit as the maximum mesh size goes to
     zero, so the integral {\int_\gamma z\ dz} does not exist in
     the sense of convergent Riemann sums even though the
     integrand {z} is extremely smooth. (Of course, such a curve
     {\gamma} cannot be rectifiable, thanks to Proposition
     [91]14.) Hint: the non-rectifiable curve in Exercise [92]11
     is a good place to start, but it turns out that this curve
     does not oscillate wildly enough to make the Riemann sums
     here diverge, because of the decay of the function {z
     \mapsto z} near the origin. Come up with a variant of this
     curve which oscillates more. Nevertheless, it is still
     possible to assign a meaning to integrals such as
     {\int_\gamma z\ dz} , as we shall see in the next set of
     notes once Cauchy’s theorem is established.

   By abuse of notation, we will refer to the quantity
   {\int_\gamma f(z)\ dz} as the contour integral of {f} along
   {\gamma} , even though {\gamma} is not necessarily a contour
   (we will define this concept shortly). We have some easy
   properties of this integral:

     Exercise 16 Let {\gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf C}} be a
     rectifiable curve, and {f: \gamma([a,b]) \rightarrow {\bf
     C}} be a continuous function.
       \equiv \gamma} is another curve equivalent to {\gamma} ,
       show that {\int_{\tilde \gamma} f(z)\ dz = \int_\gamma
       f(z)\ dz} .
       \int_\gamma f(z)\ dz} .
       some curves {\gamma_1, \gamma_2} , show that
       \displaystyle \int_\gamma f(z)\ dz = \int_{\gamma_1} f(z)\
                     dz + \int_{\gamma_2} f(z)\ dz.
       differentiable, show that
       \displaystyle \int_\gamma f(z)\ dz = \int_a^b f(\gamma(t))
                             \gamma'(t)\ dt.
       {|f(z)| \leq M} for all {z \in \gamma([a,b])} and some
       {M>0} , show that
          \displaystyle |\int_\gamma f(z)\ dz| \leq M |\gamma|.
       \gamma([a,b]) \rightarrow {\bf C}} is a continuous
       function, show that
       \displaystyle \int_\gamma c f(z)\ dz = c \int_\gamma f(z)\
                                   dz
       and
       \displaystyle \int_\gamma f(z) + g(z)\ dz = \int_\gamma
       f(z)\ dz + \int_\gamma g(z)\ dz.
       point {z_1} and terminal point {z_2} , show that
               \displaystyle \int_\gamma\ dz = z_2 - z_1.
       \rightarrow {\bf C}} , {n \geq 1} is a sequence of
       continuous functions [93]converging uniformly to {f} as {n
       \rightarrow \infty} , show that {\int_\gamma f_n(z)\ dz}
       converges to {\int_\gamma f(z)\ dz} as {n \rightarrow
       \infty} . (The requirement of uniform convergence can be
       relaxed substantially, thanks to tools such as the
       [94]dominated convergence theorem, but this weaker
       convergence theorem will suffice for most of our
       applications.)

       neighbourhood of {\gamma([a,b])} , let {\phi: U \rightarrow
       {\bf C}} be a holomorphic function, and let {g:
       \phi(\gamma([a,b])) \rightarrow {\bf C}} be a continuous
       function. Show that
            \displaystyle \int_{\phi \circ \gamma} g(w)\ dw =
                  \int_\gamma g(\phi(z)) \phi'(z)\ dz.
       (For this question, you may assume without proof that
       holomorphic functions are continuously differentiable; this
       fact will be proven (without reliance on this part of the
       exercise) in the next set of notes.)

     Exercise 17 (This exercise assumes familiarity with the
     [95]Riemann-Stieltjes integral.) Let {\gamma: [a,b]
     \rightarrow {\bf C}} be a rectifiable curve. Let {g: [a,b]
     \rightarrow {\bf C}} denote the monotone non-decreasing
     function


                \displaystyle g(T) := |\gamma_{[a,T]}|

     for {a \leq T \leq b} , where {\gamma_{[a,T]}: [a,T]
     \rightarrow {\bf C}} is the restriction of {\gamma: [a,b]
     \rightarrow {\bf C}} to {[a,T]} . For any continuous
     function {f: \gamma([a,b]) \rightarrow {\bf C}} , define the
     arclength measure integral {\int_\gamma f(z)\ |dz|} by the
     formula

           \displaystyle \int_\gamma f(z)\ |dz| := \int_a^b
                         f(\gamma(t))\ dg(t)

     where the right-hand side is a Riemann-Stieltjes integral.
     Establish the triangle inequality

        \displaystyle |\int_\gamma f(z)\ dz| \leq \int_\gamma
                             |f(z)|\ |dz|

     for any continuous {f: \gamma([a,b]) \rightarrow {\bf C}} .
     Also establish the identity

              \displaystyle \int_\gamma\ |dz| = |\gamma|

     and obtain an alternate proof of Exercise [96]16(v).

   The change of variables formula (iv) lets one compute many
   contour integrals using the familiar Riemann integral. For
   instance, if {a < b} are real numbers and {f: [a,b] \rightarrow
   {\bf C}} is continuous, then the contour integral along
   {\gamma_{a \rightarrow b}} coincides with the Riemann integral,

      \displaystyle \int_{\gamma_{a \rightarrow b}} f(z)\ dz =
                          \int_a^b f(x)\ dx

   and on reversal we also have

      \displaystyle \int_{\gamma_{b \rightarrow a}} f(z)\ dz =
              \int_b^a f(x)\ dx = - \int_a^b f(x)\ dx.

   Similarly, if {f} is continuous on the circle {\{ z \in {\bf
   C}: |z-z_0| = r \}} , we have

   \displaystyle \int_{\gamma_{z_0,r,\circlearrowleft}} f(z)\ dz =
   i \int_0^{2\pi} f(z_0+re^{i\theta}) r e^{i\theta}\ d\theta \ \
                              \ \ \ (6)

    \displaystyle = 2\pi i r \int_0^1 f(z_0 + re^{2\pi i \theta})
                     e^{2\pi i \theta}\ d\theta.

     Remark 18 We caution that if {f(z)} is real-valued, we
     cannot conclude that {\int_\gamma f(z)\ dz} is also real
     valued, unless the contour {\gamma} lies in the real line.
     This is because the complex line element {dz} may introduce
     some non-trivial imaginary part, as is the case for instance
     in [97](6). For similar reasons, we have

         \displaystyle \mathrm{Re} \int_\gamma f(z)\ dz \neq
                   \int_\gamma \mathrm{Re} f(z)\ dz

         \displaystyle \mathrm{Im} \int_\gamma f(z)\ dz \neq
                   \int_\gamma \mathrm{Im} f(z)\ dz

     and

          \displaystyle \overline{\int_\gamma f(z)\ dz} \neq
                   \int_\gamma \overline{f(z)}\ dz.

     in general. If one wishes to mix line integrals with real
     and imaginary parts, it is recommended to replace the
     contour integrals above with the [98]line integrals


          \displaystyle \int_\gamma f(x+iy) dx + g(x+iy) dy,

     which are defined as in Proposition [99]14 but where the
     expression

            \displaystyle f(\gamma(t^*_j)) (\gamma(t_j) -
                           \gamma(t_{j-1}))

     appearing in [100](5) is replaced by

       \displaystyle f(\gamma(t^*_j)) \mathrm{Re}(\gamma(t_j) -
     \gamma(t_{j-1})) + g(\gamma(t^*_j)) \mathrm{Im}(\gamma(t_j)
                         - \gamma(t_{j-1})).

     The contour integral corresponds to the special case {g=if}
     (or more informally, {dz = dx + idy} ). Line integrals are
     in turn special cases of the more general concept of
     integration of [101]differential forms, discussed for
     instance in [102]this article of mine, and which are used
     extensively in differential geometry and geometric topology.
     However we will not use these more general line integrals or
     differential form integrals much in this course.


   In later notes it will be convenient to restrict to a more
   regular class of curves than the rectifiable curves. We thus
   give the definitions here:

     Definition 19 (Smooth curves and contours) A smooth curve is
     a curve {\gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf C}} that is
     continuously differentiable, and such that {\gamma'(t) \neq
     0} for all {t \in [a,b]} . A contour is a curve that is
     equivalent to the concatenation of finitely many smooth
     curves (that is to say, a piecewise smooth curve).

     Example 20 The line segments {\gamma_{z_1 \rightarrow z_2}}
     and circles {\gamma_{z_0, r, \circlearrowright},
     \gamma_{z_0,r,\circlearrowleft}} are smooth curves and hence
     contours. Polygonal paths are usually not smooth, but they
     are contours. Any sum of finitely many contours is again a
     contour, and the reversal of a contour is also a contour.

   Note here that the term “smooth” differs somewhat here from the
   [103]real-variable notion of smoothness, which is defined to be
   “infinitely differentiable”. Smooth curves are still only
   assumed to just be continuously differentiable; we do not
   assume that the second derivative of {\gamma} exists. (In
   particular, smooth curves may have infinite [104]curvature at
   some points.) In practice, this distinction tends to be minor,
   though, as the smooth curves that one actually uses in complex
   analysis do tend to be infinitely differentiable. On the other
   hand, for most applications one does not need to control any
   derivative of a contour beyond the first.


   The following examples and exercises may help explain why the
   non-vanishing condition {\gamma'(t) \neq 0} imbues curves with
   a certain degree of “smoothness”.

     Example 21 (Cuspidal curve) Consider the curve {\gamma:
     [-1,1] \rightarrow {\bf C}} defined by {\gamma(t) := t^2 +
     it^3} . Clearly {\gamma} is continously differentiable (and
     even infinitely differentiable), but we do not view this
     curve as smooth, because {\gamma'(t) = 2t + 3it^2} vanishes
     at the origin. Indeed, the image of the curve is {\{ x + i
     x^{3/2}: 0 \leq x \leq 1 \} \cup \{ x - i x^{3/2}: 0 \leq x
     \leq 1 \}} , which looks visibly non-smooth at the origin if
     one plots it, due to the presence of a [105]cusp.


     Example 22 (Absolute value function) Consider the curve
     {\gamma: [-1,1] \rightarrow {\bf C}} defined by {\gamma(t)
     := t^5 + i |t|^5} . This curve is certainly continuously
     differentiable, and in fact is four times continuously
     differentiable, but is not smooth because {\gamma'(t) = 5
     t^4 + i 4 |t|^3 t} vanishes at the origin. The image of this
     curve is {\{ x + i |x|: -1 \leq x \leq 1\}} , which looks
     visibly non-smooth at the origin (in particular, there is no
     unique tangent line to this curve here).

     Example 23 (Spiral) Consider the curve {\gamma: [-1,1]
     \rightarrow {\bf C}} defined by {\gamma(t) := t^4 e^{i/t}}
     for {t \neq 0} , and {\gamma(0) := 0} . One can check
     (exercise!) that {\gamma} is continuously differentiable,
     even at the origin {t=0} ; but it is not a smooth curve
     because {\gamma'(0)} vanishes. The image of {\gamma} has
     some rather complicated behaviour at the origin, for
     instance it intersects itself multiple times (try to sketch
     it!).

     Exercise 24 (Local behaviour of smooth curves) Let {\gamma:
     [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf C}} be a simple smooth curve, and let
     {t_0} be an interior point of {(a,b)} . Let {\theta \in {\bf
     R}} be a phase of {\gamma'(t_0)} , thus {\gamma'(t_0)=
     re^{i\theta}} for some {r>0} . Show that for all
     sufficiently small {\varepsilon>0} , the portion
     {\gamma([a,b]) \cap D(\gamma(t_0),\varepsilon)} of the image
     of {\gamma} near {\gamma(t_0)} looks like a rotated graph,
     in the sense that

     \displaystyle \gamma([a,b]) \cap D(\gamma(t_0),\varepsilon)
         = \{ \gamma(t_0) + e^{i\theta} ( s + i f(s) ): s \in
                           I_\varepsilon \}

     for some interval {I_\varepsilon = (-c_-(\varepsilon),
     c_+(\varepsilon))} containing the origin, and some
     continuously differentiable function {f: I_\varepsilon
     \rightarrow {\bf R}} with {f(0) = f'(0) = 0} . Furthermore,
     show that {c_-(\varepsilon), c_+\varepsilon = \varepsilon +
     o(\varepsilon)} as {\varepsilon \rightarrow 0} (or
     equivalently, that {\frac{c_-(\varepsilon)}{\varepsilon},
     \frac{c_+(\varepsilon)}{\varepsilon} \rightarrow 1} as
     {\varepsilon \rightarrow 0} ). (Hint: you may find it easier
     to first work with the model case where {\gamma(t_0) = 0}
     and {\gamma'(t_0) = 1} . The real-variable [106]inverse
     function theorem will also be helpful.)


     Exercise 25 Show that a curve {\gamma} is a contour if and
     only if it is equivalent to the concatenation of finitely
     many simple smooth curves.

     Exercise 26 Show that the cuspidal curve and absolute value
     curves in Examples [107]21, [108]22 are contours, but the
     curve in Exercise [109]23 is not.

           — 2. The fundamental theorem of calculus —

   Now we establish the complex analogues of the [110]fundamental
   theorem of calculus. As in the real-variable case, there are
   two useful formulations of this theorem. Here is the first:


     Theorem 27 (First fundamental theorem of calculus) Let {U}
     be an open subset of {{\bf C}} , let {f: U \rightarrow {\bf
     C}} be a continuous function, and suppose that {f} has an
     [111]antiderivative {F: U \rightarrow {\bf C}} , that is to
     say a holomorphic function with {f(z) = F'(z)} for all {z
     \in U} . Let {\gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf C}} be a
     rectifiable curve in {U} with initial point {z_0} and
     terminal point {z_1} . Then


        \displaystyle \int_\gamma f(z)\ dz = F(z_1) - F(z_0).

   Proof: If {\gamma} were continuously differentiable, or at
   least piecewise continuously differentiable (the concatenation
   of finitely many continuously differentiable curves), we could
   establish this theorem by using Exercise [112]16 to rewrite
   everything in terms of real-variable Riemann integrals, at
   which point one can use the real-variable fundamental theorem
   of calculus (and the chain rule). But actually we can just give
   a direct proof that does not need any differentiability
   hypothesis whatsoever.

   We again use the continuity method. Let {\varepsilon > 0} , and
   for each {a \leq T \leq b} , let {\gamma_{[a,T]}: [a,T]
   \rightarrow {\bf C}} be the restriction of {\gamma: [a,b]
   \rightarrow {\bf C}} to {[a,T]} . It will suffice to show that

   \displaystyle |\int_{\gamma_{[a,T]}} f(z)\ dz - (F(\gamma(T)) -
   F(\gamma(a)))| \leq \varepsilon |\gamma_{[a,T]}| \ \ \ \ \ (7)

   for all {a \leq T \leq b} , as the claim then follows by
   setting {T=b} and sending {\varepsilon} to zero.

   Let {\Omega_\varepsilon} denote the set of all {T_* \in [a,b]}
   such that [113](7) holds for all {a \leq T \leq T_*} . As
   before, {\Omega_\varepsilon} is clearly closed and contains {a}
   ; as {[a,b]} is connected, the only remaining task is to show
   that {\Omega_\varepsilon} is open in {[a,b]} . Let {T_* \in
   \Omega_\varepsilon} be such that {T_* < b} . As {F} is
   differentiable at {\gamma(T_*)} with derivative
   {f(\gamma(T_*))} , and {\gamma} is continuous, there exists
   {\delta>0} with {[T_*,T_*+\delta] \subset [a,b]} such that

   \displaystyle |\frac{F(\gamma(T)) - F(\gamma(T_*))}{\gamma(T) -
          \gamma(T_*)} - f(\gamma(T_*))| \leq \varepsilon/2

   for any {T_* < T \leq T_*+\delta} , and hence

    \displaystyle |F(\gamma(T)) - F(\gamma(T_*)) - f(\gamma(T_*))
   (\gamma(T)-\gamma(T_*))| \leq \varepsilon/2 |\gamma_{[T_*,T]}|
                            \ \ \ \ \ (8)

   for any {T \in [T_*, T_*+\delta]} . On the other hand, if
   {\delta} is small enough, we have that

         \displaystyle |f(\gamma(t)) - f(\gamma(T_*))| \leq
                            \varepsilon/2

   for all {t \in [T_*, T_*+\delta]} , and hence by Exercise
   [114]16(v) we have

   \displaystyle |\int_{\gamma_{[T_*,T]}} (f(z) - f(\gamma(T_*)))\
         dz| \leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2} |\gamma_{[T_*, T]}|

   where {\gamma_{[T_*,T]}: [T_*,T] \rightarrow {\bf C}} is the
   restriction of {\gamma: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf C}} to {[T_*,T]}
   . Applying Exercise [115]16(vi), (vii) we thus have

          \displaystyle |\int_{\gamma_{[T_*,T]}} f(z)\ dz -
            f(\gamma(T_*)) (\gamma(T)-\gamma(T_*))| \leq
             \frac{\varepsilon}{2} |\gamma_{[T_*, T]}|.

   Combining this with [116](8) and the triangle inequality, we
   conclude that

   \displaystyle |\int_{\gamma_{[T_*,T]}} f(z)\ dz - (F(\gamma(T))
       - F(\gamma(T_*)))| \leq \varepsilon |\gamma_{[T_*,T]}|

   and on adding this to the {T=T_*} case of [117](7) and again
   using the triangle inequality, we conclude that [118](7) holds
   for all {T \in [T_*,T_*+\delta]} . This ensures that
   {\Omega_\varepsilon} is open, as desired. \Box

   One can use this theorem to quickly evaluate many integrals by
   using an antiderivative for the integrand as in the
   real-variable case. For instance, for any rectifiable curve
   {\gamma} with initial point {z_1} and terminal point {z_2} , we
   have

        \displaystyle \int_\gamma z\ dz = \frac{1}{2} z_2^2 -
                         \frac{1}{2} z_1^2,

       \displaystyle \int_\gamma e^z\ dz = e^{z_2} - e^{z_1},

   \displaystyle \int_\gamma \cos(z)\ dz = \sin(z_2) - \sin(z_1),

   and so forth. If the curve {\gamma} avoids the origin, we also
   have

   \displaystyle \int_\gamma \frac{1}{z^2}\ dz = -\frac{1}{z_2} +
                            \frac{1}{z_1}

   since {-\frac{1}{z}} is an antiderivative of {\frac{1}{z^2}} on
   {{\bf C} \backslash \{0\}} . If {\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n
   (z-z_0)^n} is a power series with radius of convergence {R} ,
   and {\gamma} is a curve in {D(z_0,R)} with initial point {z_1}
   and terminal point {z_2} , we similarly have

   \displaystyle \int_\gamma \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n (z-z_0)^n\ dz =
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n ( \frac{(z_2-z_0)^{n+1}}{n+1} -
                   \frac{(z_1-z_0)^{n+1}}{n+1} ).

   For the second fundamental theorem of calculus, we need a
   topological preliminary result.

     Exercise 28 Let {U} be a non-empty open subset of {{\bf C}}
     . Show that the following statements are equivalent:
       only two subsets of {U} that are both open and closed
       relative to {U} are the empty set and {U} itself).
       {z_1,z_2 \in U} there exists a curve {\gamma} with image in
       {U} whose initial point is {z_1} and terminal point is
       {z_2} ).
       except that {\gamma} is now required to also be a polygonal
       path).

     (Hint: to show that (i) implies (iii), pick a base point
     {z_0} in {U} and consider the set of all {z_1} in {U} that
     can be reached from {z_0} by a polygonal path.)

   We remark that the relationship between path connectedness and
   connectedness is more delicate when one does not assume that
   the space {U} is open; every path-connected space is still
   connected, but the converse need not be true.

     Remark 29 There is [119]some debate as to whether to view
     the empty set {\emptyset} as connected, disconnected, or
     neither. I view this as analogous to the debate as to
     whether the natural number {1} should be viewed as prime,
     composite, or neither. In both cases I personally prefer the
     convention of “neither” (and like to use the term
     “unconnected” to describe the empty set, and “unit” to
     describe {1} ), but to avoid any confusion I will restrict
     the discussion of connectedness to non-empty sets in this
     course (which is all we will need in applications).


   In real analysis, the second fundamental theorem of calculus
   asserts that if a function {f: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf R}} is
   continuous, then the function {F: x \mapsto \int_a^x f(y)\ dy}
   is an antiderivative of {f} . In the complex case, there is an
   analogous result, but one needs the additional requirement that
   the function is conservative:

     Theorem 30 (Second fundamental theorem of calculus) Let {U
     \subset {\bf C}} be a non-empty open connected subset of the
     complex numbers. Let {f: U \rightarrow {\bf C}} be a
     continuous function which is conservative in the sense that

         \displaystyle \int_\gamma f(z)\ dz = 0 \ \ \ \ \ (9)

     whenever {\gamma} is a closed polygonal path in {U} . Fix a
     base point {z_0 \in U} , and define the function {F: U
     \rightarrow {\bf C}} by the formula

      \displaystyle F(z_1) := \int_{\gamma_{z_0 \rightsquigarrow
                            z_1}} f(z)\ dz

     for all {z_1 \in U} , where {\gamma_{z_0 \rightsquigarrow
     z_1}} is any polygonal path from {z_0} to {z_1} in {U} (the
     existence of such a path follows from Exercise [120]28 and
     the hypothesis that {U} is connected, and the independence
     of the choice of path for the purposes of defining {F(z_1)}
     follows from Exercise [121]16 and the conservative
     hypothesis [122](9)). Then {F} is holomorphic on {U} and is
     an antiderivative of {f} , thus {f(z_1) = F'(z_1)} for all
     {z_1 \in U} .

   Proof: We mimic the proof of the real-variable second
   fundamental theorem of calculus. Let {z_1} be any point in {U}
   . As {U} is open, it contains some disk {D(z_1,r)} centred at
   {z_1} . In particular, if {z_2} lies in this disk, then the
   line segment {\gamma_{z_1 \rightarrow z_2}} will have image in
   {U} . If {\gamma_{z_0 \rightsquigarrow z_1}} is any polygonal
   path from {z_0} to {z_1} , then we have

   \displaystyle F(z_1) = \int_{\gamma_{z_0 \rightsquigarrow z_1}}
                              f(z)\ dz

   and

   \displaystyle F(z_2) = \int_{\gamma_{z_0 \rightsquigarrow z_1}

   and hence by Exercise [123]16

         \displaystyle F(z_2) - F(z_1) - f(z_1) (z_2-z_1) =
      \int_{\gamma_{z_1 \rightarrow z_2}} (f(z) - f(z_1))\ dz.

   (The reader is strongly advised to draw a picture depicting the
   situation here.) Let {\varepsilon>0} , then for {z_2}
   sufficiently close to {z_1} , we have {|f(z)-f(z_1)| \leq
   \varepsilon} for all {z} in the image of {\gamma_{z_1
   \rightarrow z_2}} . Thus by Exercise [124]16(v) we have

       \displaystyle |F(z_2) - F(z_1) - f(z_1) (z_2-z_1)| \leq
                        \varepsilon |z_2-z_1|

   for {z_2} sufficiently close to {z_1} , which implies that

    \displaystyle \lim_{z_2 \rightarrow z_1; z_2 \in U \backslash
           \{z_1\}} \frac{F(z_2)-F(z_1)}{z_2-z_1} = f(z_1)

   for any {z_1 \in U} , and thus {F} is an antiderivative of {f}
   as required. \Box

   The notion of a non-empty open connected subset {U} of the
   complex plane comes up so frequently in complex analysis that
   many texts assign a special term to this notion; for instance,
   Stein-Shakarchi refers to such sets as regions, and in other
   texts they may be called domains. We will stick to just
   “non-empty open connected subset of {{\bf C}} ” in this course.

   The requirement that {f} be conservative is necessary, as the
   following exercise shows. Actually it is also necessary in the
   real-variable case, but it is redundant in that case due to the
   topological triviality of closed polygonal paths in one
   dimension: see Exercise [125]33 below.

     Exercise 31 Let {U} be a non-empty connected subset of {{\bf
     C}} , and let {f: U \rightarrow {\bf C}} be continuous. Show
     that the following are equivalent:
       for all closed polygonal paths in {U} .
       for all simple closed polygonal paths in {U} .
       for all closed contours in {U} .
       for all closed rectifiable curves in {U} .

     (Hint: to show that (iii) implies (ii), induct on the number
     of edges in the closed polygonal path, and find a way to
     decompose non-simple closed polygonal paths into paths with
     fewer edges. One should avoid non-rigorous “hand-waving”
     arguments, and make sure that one actually has covered all
     possible cases, e.g. paths that include some backtracking.)
     Furthermore, show that if {f} has two antiderivatives {F_1,
     F_2} , then there exists a constant {C \in {\bf C}} such
     that {F_2 = F_1 + C} .

     Exercise 32 Show that the function {\frac{1}{z}} does not
     have an antiderivative on {{\bf C} \backslash \{0\}} .
     (Hint: integrate {\frac{1}{z}} on
     {\gamma_{0,1,\circlearrowleft}} .) In later notes we will
     see that {\frac{1}{z}} nevertheless does have
     antiderivatives on many subsets of {{\bf C} \backslash
     \{0\}} , formed by various branches of the [130]complex
     logarithm.


     Exercise 33 If {f: [a,b] \rightarrow {\bf C}} is a
     continuous function on an interval, show that {f} is
     conservative in the sense that [131](9) holds for any closed
     polygonal path in {[a,b]} . What happens for closed
     rectifiable paths?

     Exercise 34 Let {U} be an open subset of {{\bf C}} (not
     necessarily connected).
       of non-empty subsets of {U} that are open, connected,
       disjoint, and partition {U} : {U = \biguplus_{V \in
       {\mathcal U}} V} . (The elements of {{\mathcal U}} are
       known as the [132]connected components of {U} .)

       at most countable. (Hint: show that each connected
       component contains at least one complex number with
       rational real and imaginary parts.)
       conservative function on {U} , show that {f} has at least
       one antiderivative {F} .
       that it is possible for a function {f: U \rightarrow {\bf
       C}} to have two antiderivatives {F_1, F_2} which do not
       differ by a constant (i.e. there is no complex number {C}
       such that {F_1 = F_2 + C} ).

     Exercise 35 (Integration by parts) Let {f,g: U \rightarrow
     {\bf C}} be holomorphic functions on an open set {U} , and
     let {\gamma} be a rectifiable curve in {U} with initial
     point {z_1} and terminal point {z_2} . Prove that

      \displaystyle \int_\gamma f(z) g'(z)\ dz = f(z_2) g(z_2) -
             f(z_1) g(z_1) - \int_\gamma f'(z) g(z)\ dz.

   (The exercise below was added after the notes was originally
   written; it will be moved to a more appropriate location later,
   but is placed here so as not to disrupt the numbering of
   existing exercises.)

     Exercise 36 (Arclength parameterisation) Let {\gamma: [a,b]
     \rightarrow {\bf C}} be a rectifiable curve. Show that there
     exists a unique reparameterisation {\tilde \gamma:
     [0,|\gamma|] \rightarrow {\bf C}} with the property that for
     each {0 \leq t \leq |\gamma|} , the restriction of {\tilde
     \gamma} to {[0,t]} has arclength exactly {t} . (Hint: one
     may wish to first establish the preliminary statement that
     the arclength of the restriction of {\gamma} to {[a,t]} for
     {a \leq t \leq b} varies continuously in {t} .)
