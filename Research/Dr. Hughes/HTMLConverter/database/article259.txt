Segmenting Ultrasound Video with a Wavelet Variational Model

   By [49]Lina Sorg


   Image segmentation, the process of separating a digital image
   into multiple sections for individual examination, is
   frequently used in medical image analysis. For example,
   segmentation in ultrasound footage helps identify boundaries
   and regions of interest (ROI) that facilitate image
   interpretation. Efficient segmentation of ultrasound videos,
   however, is often complicated by low contrast, shadow effects,
   and complex “noise” statistics (unexplained variations). In
   addition, real-time applications such as navigation during
   operational surgery require efficient algorithms.

   In an article published this month in the [50]SIAM Journal on
   Imaging Sciences, authors Jiulong Liu, Xiaoqun Zhang, Bin Dong,
   Zuowei Shen, and Lixu Gu propose a video segmentation model to
   recognize ROI in ultrasounds.


   “The proposed model aims to track a moving boundary in
   ultrasound video efficiently and robustly, with a
   mathematically-sound framework,” says Zhang. “Specifically, we
   tackle the problem by using wavelet frames and incorporating
   the noise statistics under a variational framework. The
   continuity and regularity of the moving boundary is effectively
   incorporated via weighted regularization, without introducing a
   heavy computational burden. The overall method can be
   efficiently solved with a recently-developed fast algorithm,
   making it useful in real-time clinical applications.”

   Multiple published methods of image segmentation currently
   exist, but Liu et al. specifically implement variational
   methods, which are commonly used for motion tracking and edge
   detection due to their modeling flexibility. “Variational
   methods have been demonstrated to be robust and effective for
   complicated image segmentation tasks,” says Dong. “The
   variational framework permits solid theoretical analysis of the
   models that can well guide the modeling itself and provide
   fundamental understanding of the solutions.”

   Liu et al. also chose to incorporate wavelet frames, which
   collect more detail than other variational methods and
   efficiently segment low-quality footage, such as ultrasound
   video. This is especially true when the image includes features
   at various scales. “Wavelet frame regularization is used
   because the geometric structures and singularities in different
   scales can be identified and extracted efficiently from complex
   noise environments in the wavelet domain,” says Shen. “It
   allows us to track and sharpen geometric shapes when they are
   segmented automatically through sequential images in the
   video.”

   The authors designed their model to segment an ultrasound video
   both sequentially and collectively. The model incorporates
   shape priors – a type of probability distribution – in
   single-image segmentation and computes consecutive shape priors
   automatically for subsequent segmentations.

   Liu et al. apply their model to two ultrasound video data sets
   and obtain numerical results, which confirm the model’s ability
   to efficiently track ROI. “Ultrasound imaging is an important
   modality in clinical application due to its low cost and
   portability,” says Liu. “However, its related analysis for
   accurate diagnosis and monitoring is still challenging due to
   low image quality, artifacts, and noise. The numerical results
   on real ultrasound data sets demonstrate that the proposed
   wavelet frame model with distance prior can track the regions
   of interest effectively, in terms of both segmentation quality
   and computational time.” The results compare favorably with
   other approaches.

   The model’s success could improve medical approaches and
   technology that rely on image segmentation, and Liu et al. are
   looking to expand its use. “The model can be further extended
   to other imaging modality or to locate multi-region
   simultaneously,” says Liu. “More geometric and prior
   information can be used to enhance the robustness of the
   method.” Such advancements will continue to increase the speed,
   efficiency, and performance of image segmentation.
