   LOGAN, UTAH, USA - The oft-quoted proverb, "Too many cooks
   spoil the broth," is apt wisdom for describing challenges
   facing policy makers, public resource managers, ag producers,
   industry, residents and other stakeholders in attempts to
   jointly tackle major environmental restoration projects. The
   myriad of varied interests -- some conflicting; some aligning -
   results in a confusing tangle of authority and responsibility.

   "Resource management boundaries seldom align with environmental
   systems," says Utah State University researcher Jacopo Baggio.
   "This can lead to a variety of social and ecological problems."

   But an answer to this struggle, known alternately as "scale
   mismatch" or "spatial misalignments," may lie in the power of
   math.

   With colleague Jesse Sayles of McGill University, Baggio
   employed analytic modeling to unravel the confusion in a case
   study of estuary watershed restoration efforts in Washington's
   Puget Sound. The team reports development of quantitative tools
   to foster collaboration and efficient coordination of resources
   in the Feb. 20, 2017, Early Edition of the Proceedings of the
   National Academy of Sciences. Their work is supported by the
   National Science Foundation.

   Mapping and analyzing social networks among resource management
   organizations can identify how divergent groups work together
   and ease conflicts at local, state, regional and national
   levels, he says.

   "The challenges facing Puget Sound, and areas around the world
   with similar challenges, are often the result of many small
   impacts," Sayles says. "Not all stakeholders get the direct
   burden of a particular ecosystem problem, nor do all receive
   equal benefits. Yet everyone affects the system."

   Baggio and Sayles' approach, using social-ecological network
   analysis, illuminates network connections among stakeholders,
   revealing strengths and weaknesses in communication and
   collaboration.

   "Integrating network analysis results with ecological habitat
   data provides a social-environmental restoration planning
   perspective," Sayles says. "This research can help policy
   makers allocate resources. It's a fundamental step toward
   addressing scale mismatch, while considering multi-level
   governance."
