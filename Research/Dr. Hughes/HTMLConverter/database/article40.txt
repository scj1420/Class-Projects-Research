   Should “elements of $\{1,…,n\}$” read “subsets” instead?

   For n functions the answer seems to be
   \frac{\ln \frac{n^{n}}{(n-1)^{n-1}}}{\ln n} . And it
   approeaches to 1 as 1+\frac{1}{\ln n} when n goes to infinity

   [Hmm, I think you’re right, and the proof methods extend to
   this setting. We’ll add a remark to this effect in the next
   revision of the ms. -T.]

   The notation f_1\ast f_2\ast f_3(1,\ldots,1) is clear in the
   paper but is somewhat opaque in the post (or at least it was
   opaque to me!)

   Minor remark: I think there is a slightly simpler proof of
   inequality (1.4) in the paper.
   If the left-hand side achieves a maximum for a,b,c\in(0,1)^3 ,
   one can prove that (a,b,c)=(2/3,2/3,2/3) :
   imposing the vanishing of the differential, one gets that
   A:=\frac{1-a}{a} , B:=\frac{1-b}{b} , C:=\frac{1-c}{c} satisfy
   A^{1-1/p}(B^{1/p}+C^{1/p})=1\ (*_A) and the two other equations
   obtained by permutation of A,B,C .
   Assuming wlog that A\le B,C , we have \lambda:=\frac{B}{A}\ge 1
   , \mu:=\frac{C}{A}\ge 1 . Comparison of (*_A) and (*_B) gives
   \lambda^{1/p}+\mu^{1/p}=\lambda^{1-1/p}(1+\mu^{1/p}) , but
   since \frac{1}{p}\le 1-\frac{1}{p} this equation can only hold
   if \lambda=1 . Similarly \mu=1 and we deduce A=B=C=\frac{1}{2}
   ,
   i.e. (a,b,c)=(2/3,2/3,2/3) . The case when (1.4) has a minimum
   on the boundary of the cube is simpler.

       Unfortunately the inequality \frac{1}{p} \leq 1 -
       \frac{1}{p} is false. As discussed in the paper, there are
       other critical points arising from local minima rather than
       local maxima; in your notation, one of them is (A,B,C)
       \approx (0.09343, 0.09343, 4.85147) .

   Echoing Kodlu’s complaint: I originally assumed that \ast was
   convolution treating the Hamming cube as an abelian group of
   order 2^n . It was only after some confusion that I realized we
   were considering the Hamming cube as a subset of \mathbb{Z}^n
   and convolving in that group. The paper’s statement is
   ambiguous on this point as well, although by time I looked that
   up I was alert to the issue.

   This optimal exponent implies that the ratio of the best known
   upper bound to the best known lower bound for the above number
   of partitions is |X|^{o(1)} . Can this growth estimate of this
   ratio be improved ? (or even be made bounded?)

       Probably it can be improved. One needs to replace the
       right-hand side |X_1|^{1/p} |X_2|^{1/p} |X_3|^{1/p} in the
       fourth-display by some more complicated “Bellman function”
       F(|X_1|, |X_2|, |X_3|) of the three sizes that grows a
       little bit more slowly than |X|^{3/p} on the diagonal, and
       also gains something when the |X_1|, |X_2|, |X_3| are
       different sizes from each other. One will probably have to
       do some Taylor expansion calculations near the critical
       point (a,b,c) = (2/3,2/3,2/3) of the elementary inequality
       used here in order to make sure the induction closes
       properly.

       But how to close the induction? If little o is in n in the
       expression |X|^{o(1)} then the “Bellman function” F should
       also depend on n . I don’t quite see how these quantities
       propagate, or maybe I misunderstood the question.

       In the paper, the gap between the upper and lower bounds is
       of the form 1/n^{O(1)} , which is not quite the same thing
       as |X|^{o(1)} , though in the key examples, X is of
       exponential size in n so the gap should be something like
       1/\log^{O(1)} |X| . To make the induction close, I think
       one should use a Bellman function that is independent of n
       and which is smaller than |X|^{3/p} by a power of \log|X|
       when |X_1|=|X_2|=|X_3|=|X| ; it has to be carefully chosen
       not only in the main region where |X_1| \sim |X_2| \sim
       |X_3| but also in the extreme cases when say one of the
       |X_i| is much smaller than the other two (this corresponds
       to the fact that in addition to the main critical point
       (2/3,2/3,2/3) of the key inequality, we also have critical
       points at (1,1,0) and permutations). Finding the precise
       Bellman function that works may require a certain amount of
       trial and error and iteration (trying one Bellman function,
       finding out the locations where the induction fails to
       close, tweaking the Bellman function to repair the
       induction in that case, and then seeing if this causes the
       induction to stop working at some other location, repeating
       as necessary).

       Given integer A=|X|>1 we want to find nonnegative function
       B on [0,A]^{3} such that B(1,1,1)=1 and
       B(a_{1},a_{2},b_{3})+B(a_{1},b_{2},a_{3})

       B(a_{1}+b_{1},a_{2}+b_{2},a_{3}+b_{3}) . And the goal is to
       minimize B(A,A,A) . This problem was solved when A \to
       \infty with B(x,y,z)=x^{1/p}y^{1/p}z^{1/p} . But for fixed
       A>1 the best possible B does not have to be this one, it
       can be smaller. Is this what was meant in your first
       comment? The only thing that is not clear to me why this
       main inequality that I wrote on B (and which closes
       induction easily) should be also necessary for the true B ,
       i.e., I mean yes I agree, it is sufficient to solve the
       problem and find some bound, but is it also necessary,
       i.e., will the result give me sharp bound?

   Here is the proof for the finite number of functions (not
   necessarily 2) which corresponds to n partitions instead of
   $2$.
   =0
   Again the question boils down to the Hamming cube \{-1,1\} of
   dimension 1 and the best possible power for the convolution
   inequality is p = \frac{\ln \frac{n^{n}}{(n-1)^{n-1}}}{\ln n} ,
   and for the number of n-1 partitions we obtain N/p ( I am not
   sure if N/p is the optimal power for N>3 (I just did not think
   about the example).

   you should make intervals, make in it a convergent series, make
   an increasing function on a subset n- (n- (n / i) of
   the starting set for i ranging from 1 to n,
   you make a deterministic decomposition (we know the arrival) of
   the function. Then you remove an interval, and we will have a
   cos and sin function.
   The limit at 0 is n ^ 2 – n / i for i ranging from 1 to n.

   Dear Terence Tao! I proceed with big interest to read your
   notes and want to give reply on “trilinear” bound.
   ——Quarks in quantum chromodynamics.—— In inequality
   |X1|~|X2|~|X3| it is necessary to apply meanings u,d,s.
   Accordingly:
   |X1|=u, |X2|=d, |X3|=s, because quarks u,d,s to have various
   quantum numbers. In equality |X1|=|X2|=|X3|=|X| it is necessary
   to apply meaninqs u,u,u. Accordingly:–
   |X1|=u, |X2|=u, |X3|=u, because quarks u,u,u to have identical
   quantum numbers and directions. Matrixs of Gell-Mann (3×3) to
   form algebra ASU(3). Thus, in this way gauge theory, base on
   group SU(3), open approach for theory of Yang-Mills.Constrained
   quarks in groups SU(3)=(u,d,s) or SU(3)=(u,u,u) give
   possibility to approach for demonstration of Rieman hypothesis
   with other side. Fourth-display=>this metric siqnature(+—).
