   Welcome to The Riddler. Every week, I offer up a problem
   related to the things we hold dear around here: math, logic and
   probability. These problems, puzzles and riddles come from many
   top-notch puzzle folks around the world ‚Äî including you! You‚Äôll
   find this week‚Äôs puzzle below.

   Mull it over on your commute, dissect it on your lunch break
   and argue about it with your friends and lovers. When you‚Äôre
   ready, submit your answer using the link below. I‚Äôll reveal the
   solution next week, and a correct submission (chosen at random)
   will earn a shoutout in this column. Important small print: To
   be eligible, I need to receive your correct answer before 11:59
   p.m. EDT on Sunday. Have a great weekend!

   Before we get to the new puzzle, let‚Äôs return to [19]last
   week‚Äôs. Congratulations to üëè Christopher Tiee üëè of San Diego,
   our big winner. You can find a solution to the previous Riddler
   at the bottom of this post.


   Now here‚Äôs this week‚Äôs Riddler, a twist on a classic passed
   along by Scott Rodilitz, a Ph.D. student in operations at Yale.
     __________________________________________________________

   You have a camel and 3,000 bananas. (Because of course you do.)
   You would like to sell your bananas at the bazaar 1,000 miles
   away. Your loyal camel can carry at most 1,000 bananas at a
   time. However, it has an insatiable appetite and quite the nose
   for bananas ‚Äî if you have bananas with you, it will demand one
   banana per mile traveled. In the absence of bananas on his
   back, it will happily walk as far as needed to get more
   bananas, loyal beast that it is. What should you do to get the
   largest number of bananas to the bazaar? What is that number?

   Extra credit: Let‚Äôs push this classic even further and offer up
   a üèÜ Coolest Riddler Extension Award üèÜ. Add a second camel,
   another fruit, a closer but less profitable bazaar, or
   something even more creative. Submit your extension and its
   solution via the form below. The winner gets a shiny emoji
   trophy next week.

   Need a hint? You can try [21]asking me nicely. Want to submit a
   new puzzle or problem? [22]Email me. I‚Äôm especially on the hunt
   for Riddler Express problems ‚Äî bite-size puzzles that don‚Äôt
   take quite as much time or computational power to solve.

   And here‚Äôs the solution to [23]last week‚Äôs Riddler, concerning
   a very particular mathematician, his birthday cake and the
   memento he wants to fit the cake in. If you make the largest
   three-tier cake that fits under the mathematician‚Äôs glass cone,
   it will fill about 70.2 percent of the cone‚Äôs volume. If the
   cone is 1 unit tall, the heights of the tiers, from bottom to
   top, should be roughly 0.162, 0.182 and 0.219.


   This is a [24]constrained optimization problem. We want to
   optimize the volume of the cake, because a mathematician told
   us to and cake is delicious, subject to the constraints of the
   dimensions of the cone.


   Here‚Äôs how to do that, adapted from the solution of the
   puzzle‚Äôs submitter, Jim Crimmins. Let \(A_B\) be the area of
   the cone‚Äôs base and \(H\) be its height. The volume of the cone
   is therefore \(V_C=(1/3)A_B H\).

   Let the heights of the cake layers be \(a\), \(b\) and \(c\),
   expressed as percentages of \(H\). The volumes of the three
   layers are then:

   $$V_a = ((1-a)^2 A_B) \cdot aH$$

   $$V_b = ((1-a-b)^2 A_B) \cdot bH$$

   $$V_c = ((1-a-b-c)^2 A_B) \cdot cH$$

   The total volume of the cake, \(V_T\), is the sum of those
   three. The percentage of the cone the cake fills ‚Äî the number
   we want to maximize ‚Äî is \(P\).

   $$P=V_T/V_C=3\left(a(1-a)^2+b(1-a-b)^2+c(1-a-b-c)^2\right)$$

   We want to maximize \(P\) subject to \(a+b+c\leq 1\). (The
   total height of the layers can‚Äôt exceed the height of the cone,
   after all.) [25]Solving that ‚Äî basically un-repressing your
   memories of calculus class and taking partial derivatives and
   setting them equal to zero ‚Äî gives us our optimal heights and
   our optimal volume.


   For extra credit, I asked what the cake would look like if it
   had N layers. The proportion of the cone we can fill as N goes
   to infinity is clearly 1. The precise math on the way to
   infinity gets pretty messy, and I‚Äôm not aware of a closed-form
   solution for the optima. However, you can see these nice
   approaches from [26]Joachim Worthington and [27]Daniel Filan
   for two examples out of the many nice ones I received. And here
   is a chart of the [28]optimized volumes, as the number of cake
   tiers increases, from Laurent Lessard:
   bdaycake-1024x662


   And here is the progression of the shape of the optimal cake:

     the top! [30]@ollie [31]@DimEarly [32]@RandiGoldman
