   Beautiful fractals help solve wiggly problems

   Mathematicians explain how beauty of fractals goes far beyond
   pretty pictures

   When Harry Potter first went to Hogwarts, he caught his train
   from Kings Cross, platform 9¾.

   The idea of a platform between two whole numbers might seem
   impossible to imagine. However, for someone working with
   fractals in math, the challenge is not so different. Fractals
   are used to measure things between dimensions, as in something
   that’s more than 2D, but not quite 3D.

   Additionally, fractals in mathematics serve as visual
   representations of “self-similarity,” or patterns that repeat
   to infinity. This kind of information allows them to sort out
   new ways to efficiently compress data files or narrow down
   forecasts for “wiggly” problems -- those that involve rapid
   erratic behavior with seemingly unpredictable movements,
   including real-world issues like the stock market or climate
   change.

   Today, non-mathematicians who happen to be familiar with
   fractals are more likely aware of their beauty. A fiddlehead
   fern, a gecko’s footpads, a flashy bolt of lightning -- these
   are all reminiscent of fractal images. And while nature seems
   to provide an array of these beauties, humanity has added more
   to the mix through kaleidoscopes, architecture and, yes, even
   those wiggly math problems.

   As the start of the 2016 International Math Olympiad draws
   near, three NSF program directors from the Division of
   Mathematical Science -- Lora Billings, Edward Taylor and
   Frederi Viens -- provide some facts on fractals.

   What is a fractal?

   Billings: The way we were describing it, these are pictures or
   objects. You’re trying to classify the object in some way in
   terms of how wiggly it is. There are the dimensions we’re all
   familiar with -- zero dimension for a point, one dimension
   (north or south) for a line, two pi radians of a circle for 2D
   -- but some objects just can’t be given meaningful integer
   dimensions, and fractions accommodate things that don’t fit.

   Viens: If I wanted to construct a fractal, I would take a
   simple rule, like adding three small triangles on the edge of a
   big triangle like a [95]Koch snowflake, which is used to
   understand fractal geometry. Then, the rule is repeated again
   and again. On the flip side, if you’re staring at a picture of
   a fractal, you could say, “Wow, that’s complex, how do I
   describe it?” This construction is a very simple way to do
   that. The notion that you are between numbers still brings you
   back to numbers in between whole numbers.


   Where did fractals come from? And why were they created?

   Taylor: Fractals are a very old topic that dates back to the
   early 20^th century. One person, the French mathematician
   Gaston Julia, was important in the development of this. It came
   up out of this notion that you could build these very complex
   sets through an iterative process.

   Billings: In my own work, I have created fractals related to
   how wind would move oceanographic sensors in an eddy (shown
   above). The two colors represent which of the two basins you
   would drift toward (left and right). Notice the complex
   structure in the layers of the two colors near the boundary.
   This is just a snapshot in time, but wind would push the
   sensors back and forth in a stochastic -- a kind of organized
   randomness -- way. So, near the boundary, it isn’t very clear
   to which basin the sensor will head. That’s why I like to say,
   “A picture is worth a thousand words.” The point was to come up
   with an optimal, minimalistic control for the sensors to use as
   little battery as possible and keep them on the left side with
   small chance of displacement. This is something you can
   recreate in experimental settings, like tanks in a lab.

   Viens: We also have huge gyres in the ocean where plastic is
   collecting, and one might use this same sort of fractal
   modeling to better understand that problem.

   How else are fractals used?

   Taylor: People don’t realize when they look at it, but computer
   game graphics and their varied backgrounds are just copies of
   things over and over again. It’s a combination of linear
   algebra and fractals.

   Billings: You can actually find patterns in some data that help
   to compress it, too. That way you can send data along very
   quickly. If you want to send a picture, and your picture is
   three gigabytes, you can find a simple way -- a rule -- to
   compress this data and then all of a sudden explode it again.
   If a picture has enough of this sort of fractal imagery in it,
   these algorithms work very well.

   Viens: MP3 files that we have on our devices are about 10 times
   smaller than a CD’s digital files. On an LP, there’s
   essentially an infinite amount of information because it’s
   analog. But the MP3 is so compressed you can’t listen to
   classical music because a lot of the instruments get drowned
   out as a result of some loss of information.

   What are some of the wiggliest problems fractals address,
   though?

   Viens: In probability theory, one application for fractals is
   modeling financial markets, which are known for their wiggly
   behavior. The S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average over a
   day might have a few jumps, but if you look at it over a week
   or even a year, then you can see jagged ups and downs. That’s
   when you can use these models, which really have a fractal
   behavior. You can discern a sort of order in the random chaos
   these models have and that’s the stochasticity we already
   mentioned.

   But we can’t predict what stocks will do each day this way, can
   we?

   Viens: No, we can’t do that. However, financial markets’
   self-similarity is actually very simple. The magnitude of how
   much your stock may move up and down is proportional to the
   square of the magnitude of how much time has elapsed. So if a
   stock tends to swing up and down by 20 percent in a year, it
   will tend to swing up or down by 10 percent in three months,
   twice as fast as one might expect without this fractal
   self-similarity. If the models and rules are simple enough --
   even if they are stochastic -- you can absolutely make
   probabilistic predictions. So you can make a conclusion on the
   chance something is going to occur or not occur in the future.
   But it’s only ever a chance.

   We see beautiful fractals in nature. Are there any constructed
   by non-mathematicians that are noteworthy as well?

   Viens: One of the world’s most extraordinary buildings is the
   Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, designed by Antoni Gaudí. He
   studied how plants grow and noticed patterns and fractals --
   how a leaf connects to the stem and how much light it’s
   getting. He considered all this when he built this cathedral in
   a way to maximize light. Compared to this modernist Gothic
   cathedral, other 15^th century Gothic cathedrals had nowhere as
   much light penetrating them. He maximized light by using
   geometry and included fractal structures -- a stem that splits
   up and splits again. I believe this is one of the most
   beautiful human-made fractals.
