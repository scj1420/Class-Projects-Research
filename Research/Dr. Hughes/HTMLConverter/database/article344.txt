   If I flip a coin, look at the result, but don‚Äôt show you, its
   state is random for you but not for me. Probability describes
   knowledge.

            Kolmogorov have shown that probability theory is a
            branch of the measure theory of spaces of measure 1.
            Knowledge? Measuring?

            Kolmogorov is just 1 pure math model (no
            interpretation) of 1 part of probability

       Yeah, with perfect knowledge in a deterministic world, the
       probability of the propositions you'd assert would increase
       to 1.

       the distinction between epistemic and ontological
       probability! After the coin flip, the randomness is
       epistemic.

       You mean probability describes *lack of* knowledge.

       "Fair coin" is a property of your belief, not a property of
