   Prime Numbers, Friends Who Give Problems is a charming book,
   written as a conversation between mathematician Papa Paulo and
   his grandsons. Papa Paulo begins their conversation by defining
   prime numbers, and works up to well-known conjectures such as
   the Twin Primes Conjecture. Along the way, he gives an overview
   of what is known about prime numbers, including tests for
   primality, the use of primes in cryptography, the Prime Number
   Theorem, and the search for ever-larger prime numbers. The book
   also includes brief biographies of some of the mathematicians
   whose work on prime numbers is discussed in the conversations.

   Ribenboim doesnâ€™t shy away from including proofs and fairly
   technical computations, so a reader does need to have some
   mathematics background (at the level of an advanced high school
   student or beginning math major) and a strong interest in
   mathematics to enjoy the book. The conversation format lessens
   the intimidation-factor of the early proofs, since Papa Paulo
   and his grandsons develop them through discussion. Throughout
   the book, Papa Paulo encourages his young conversation partners
   to ask questions and think for themselves. A motivated reader
   can learn not only about prime numbers, but also something
   about how mathematicians think, work, and ask questions from
   reading this book.
