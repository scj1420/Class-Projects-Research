   After Edward O. Thorp devised a mathematical way to win at
   gambling, he turned his attention to beating Wall Street — “
   the greatest casino on earth.” (Gary Thompson/AP)
   By Margaret Wertheim By Margaret Wertheim February 9

   Margaret Wertheim is a science writer and author of books on
   the cultural history of physics.

   Halfway through Edward O. Thorp’s lark-filled account of his
   pioneering career as a gambler and inventor of stock-trading
   tools, he tells us that “gambling is investing simplified.” So
   by reverse, investing is gambling complexified. A good deal of
   Thorp’s life has been devoted to proving that the same kinds of
   mathematical skills that come in handy counting cards can also
   be fruitfully applied to “the greatest casino on earth”: Wall
   Street.

   Thorp has won in both arenas. As a young mathematician at MIT
   in the early 1960s, he developed a theoretical framework that
   showed how a blackjack player could beat the house advantage,
   despite centuries of mathematical reasoning that had supposedly
   proved this impossible. Once he published his “high-low” system
   in his bestselling book “Beat the Dealer” (1962), it unleashed
   an army of math nerds who brought such an onslaught of science
   to bear on the game that it forced casinos to change their
   rules, including moving from one deck of cards in a shoe to
   several. Legions of professional blackjack teams using Thorp’s
   system have engaged in a Darwinian war with casinos ever since,
   among them a legendary MIT team whose exploits inspired[190]
   the film “21,” starring Kevin Spacey.

   Thorp’s experience with the mathematics of blackjack, and later
   other casino games such as roulette and baccarat, prompted him
   to start applying his talents to the stock market. Here, too,
   he found ways to beat the system by discovering and exploiting
   pricing anomalies in securities. “Betting on a hedge I had
   researched was like betting on a blackjack hand where I had the
   advantage,” he writes, only instead of $500 a hand, the stakes
   were now “$50,000 to $100,000 per hedge.”
   "A Man for All Markets: From Las Vegas to Wall Street, How I
   Beat the Dealer and the Market," by Edward O. Thorp and Nassim
   Nicholas Taleb (Random House)

   Although Thorp didn’t invent hedging, he made significant
   theoretical contributions to its development and thus became
   one of the quants who revolutionized Wall Street. At one point
   his Princeton/Newport Partners was beating the stock market by
   more than 20 percent. For those lucky enough to have what
   eventually became a $10 million minimum, Thorp could almost
   guarantee brilliant returns: PNP “never had a losing year, or
   even a losing quarter,” he states.

   With his Rockyesque rounds of beating the odds, Thorp has led a
   remarkable life, but what strikes me most about his story is
   what happened before he set foot in a casino. As he describes
   his early years and the obstacles he overcame, we have a
   narrative arc with some of the same qualities as that of Louis
   Zamperini, the Olympic track-star hero of Laura Hillenbrand’s
   “Unbroken,” who grew up just a few miles from Thorp in a
   disadvantaged suburb of Los Angeles County.

   Before he got the gambling bug, Thorp had been pursuing a life
   in science, and what a life!

   Born in 1932, Thorp grew up a Depression-era son of caring, but
   hugely overworked, blue-collar parents, who often labored on
   night shifts and, of necessity, largely left their two sons to
   raise themselves. During World War II, his mother worked as a
   riveter at Douglas Aircraft, and his father, who’d attended
   college for a year on the GI bill, was unable to afford to
   complete his degree. Both hoped Edward would be able to partake
   of the education they’d been denied.

   Left to his own devices in a C-grade school district, Thorp was
   a self-starter who taught himself chemistry and built a
   homemade lab in which, like the young Oliver Sacks, one of his
   chief lines of research was blowing stuff up. He learned to
   make gunpowder and used it to launch rockets and rocket-powered
   sleds. He progressed to gun-cotton and nitroglycerine and
   nearly blew off his hand before wisely deciding to stop. Like
   Sacks (in his memoir “Uncle Tungsten”), Thorp understands the
   horror these exploits will induce in the minds of contemporary
   parents and is grateful for the freedom that gave him an
   education that couldn’t be learned solely from books.

   As a high school junior, he decided to enter a chemistry
   competition in which the prizes were scholarships to leading
   universities. Having skipped a grade, he was just 15, and most
   of the competition would be 17- and 18-year-old seniors. But,
   since his parents couldn’t help him with college fees, a
   scholarship was the only way he might realize his dream of
   becoming a scientist. Unfortunately, he couldn’t afford a
   proper slide rule, so he was unable to complete enough
   calculations during the exam and only came in third in a field
   stacked with kids from L.A’.s elite schools. The next year, he
   taught himself physics and was one of 40 finalists, out of
   16,000 entrants, in the national Westinghouse Science Talent
   Search, which won him a scholarship to Berkeley.

   There, too, he encountered unfairness, causing him to switch
   fields from chemistry to quantum physics, and finally to a PhD
   in math at UCLA. His trajectory reflects the movements in a
   pinball machine, and Thorp acknowledges that in other economic
   circumstances, his career might have been different. Financial
   difficulty helped fuel his attraction to gambling, though he
   insists he wasn’t in it for the money: “What intrigued me was
   the possibility that merely by sitting in a room and thinking,
   I could figure out how to win.”

   There are several questions opened up here: What if this
   beautiful mind hadn’t been hampered by pecuniary problems? What
   else might Thorp have achieved? With a decent slide rule, he’d
   probably have won the chemistry competition and a place at
   Caltech. “Science [was] my playground,” he says, and one rather
   mourns the loss to science. How many other Thorps are being
   thwarted?

   And why does it take gambling to ignite enthusiasm for
   mathematics among publishers? When Thorp began his blackjack
   calculations at MIT, he was a post-doc in one of the world’s
   great math departments. We get endless details about
   card-counting and not a hint about his research. I wanted to
   know about his day job. Thorp remained in academics until 1982,
   professing a love for research and teaching, but the financials
   finally took over — as they have done for an increasing number
   of mathematicians. This seems to me an enormous loss, not only
   because the quants have already brought us once to the brink of
   ruin, but because so much IQ is being channeled away.

   The second half of Thorp’s book is a history of the financial
   world over the past 50 years, with its growing reliance on
   math, and it makes for pretty unsavory reading. By his telling,
   the rewards will be deeply divided between the rich and the
   rest. Along with Warren Buffett, he urges us to put our money
   safely into index funds. Just as most gamblers can’t beat the
   house, most of us can’t beat the market. “Gambling now is
   largely a socially corrosive tax on ignorance, draining money
   from those who cannot afford the losses,” he writes in his
   closing pages. “Most of what I’ve learned from gambling is also
   true for investing.” It is to Thorp’s credit as a human being
   that he lands his final punch straight.
