   [3]What are some counterintuitive results in game theory?
   originally appeared on [4]Quora: the knowledge sharing network
   where compelling questions are answered by people with unique
   insights.


   [5]Answer by [6]William Chen, Data Scientist, on [7]Quora:


   My favorite example of a counterintuitive result of game theory
   is Braess' paradox, which says that:

   I'm going to walk through the common example of Braess' paradox
   using figures and rephrasing the explanation from Wikipedia.

   The Situation: We have 4,000 drivers that want to go from START
   to END. The solid line (directed edges on the network) are
   roads available initially, and the dashed line is the road that
   is added later.

   A driver will either take 45 minutes to traverse a road (the
   roads labelled 45), or T/100 minutes, where T is the total
   amount of traffic on that road.

   Scenario before the added road: Only the solid lines are
   available as roads. At equilibrium, 2,000 drivers will go
   through each of A and B. Each driver will take 65 minutes to go
   from the start to end, and no driver has an incentive to
   deviate from their route, as they would take slightly longer to
   reach their final destination.

   Scenario after the added road: Now we add the dashed line as a
   road. It's a short road that takes no time to traverse. The
   equilibrium now is that all drivers take the T/100 road to A,
   go over the short road to B, and then take the T/100 road to
   END. No driver has the incentive to deviate here, because
   choosing to take a T/100 road will always be faster than
   choosing to take the 45 minute road, since there are only a max
   of 4,000 drivers taking that road at any given time. Since now
   all 4,000 drivers are taking both of the T/100 roads, the total
   travel time is expected to be 80 minutes.

   Why this happens: We see that by building an extra road in our
   traffic network, we've actually made traffic worse.

   The non-technical explanation of this is that drivers act
   selfishly, and will take whatever road is best for them. This
   causes the "shortcut" to become overused, which directs drivers
   to roads that easily end up becoming congested. The T/100 road
   might be a better choice for any individual driver, but by
   choosing that road, a driver hurts every single other driver
   that also chooses to traverse that path.

   The technical explanation is that adding the road to the
   network causes a less-efficient Nash Equilibrium to develop
   (and we know that Nash Equilibriums aren't always the most
   efficient global solution anyways).

   Note that drivers acting selfishly is the cause of this
   paradox. This is a related to the concept of [8]Tragedy of the
   Commons, where everyone is worse off because they act selfishly
   instead of in the cooperative manner. Another related concept
   is the [9]Price of Anarchy (economics), which measures how much
   worst off a system is when everyone acts selfishly. If somehow
   our Google Maps applications could help benevolently coordinate
   local traffic away from easily-congested roads, extra roads
   would never make the traffic worse (this would require Google
   Maps to optimize everyone’s traffic, and not just selfishly
   optimize a single commuter’s traffic.)


   Examples of this happening in real life: You can see how it
   works in a purely theoretical example. Wikipedia points out
   some cases where this happens in real life too!

     In [10]Seoul, [11]South Korea, a speeding-up in traffic
     around the city was seen when a motorway was removed as part
     of the [12]Cheonggyecheon restoration project.[13][4]
     In [14]Stuttgart, [15]Germany, after investments into the
     road network in 1969, the traffic situation did not improve
     until a section of newly built road was closed for traffic
     again.[16][5] In 1990 the closing of 42nd street in [17]New
     York City reduced the amount of congestion in the
     area.[18][6] In 2008 Youn, Gastner and Jeong demonstrated
     specific routes in Boston, New York City and London where
     this might actually occur and pointed out roads that could
     be closed to reduce predicted travel times.[19][7]
