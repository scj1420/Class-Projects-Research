   Marcelo studied Mathematics at the Universidad de la Republica
   in Uruguay and then at Cornell University in Ithaca. He was
   fortunate to be mentored by great people such as Walter
   Ferrer-Santos, Steve Chase, and Andre Joyal. Other influential
   people have been Lou Billera, Ken Brown, Persi Diaconis and
   Gian-Carlo Rota. He taught at Texas A&M University and is now a
   full professor at Cornell University. He regards his prior and
   ongoing monographs with Swapneel Mahajan as his most valuable
   contributions to the field.
   His research interests include topics in noncommutative
   algebra, category theory and algebraic combinatorics, with Hopf
   algebras and their generalizations appearing prominently. A
   goal of his past work has been to build a conceptual framework
   for the study of Hopf algebraic structures in combinatorics and
   to clarify its significance to concrete applications. Part of
   his current work is devoted to enlarging the scope of classical
   Hopf-Lie theory. The new theory includes hyperplane
   arrangements and idempotent semigroups as part of the
   fundamental data. He is developing it in joint work with his
   colleague and friend Swapneel Mahajan.
