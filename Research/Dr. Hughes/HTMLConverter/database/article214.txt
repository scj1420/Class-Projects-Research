       I love the post, however I was thrown for a loop and had to
       re-read to follow the explanation when you got to ‚ÄúOr, if
       we want, we can consider not just individual columns, but
       bands of columns, like this:‚Äù.
       Personally I think it would have been clearer if the
       diagrams you did after that used unique colors [not yellow,
       blue & purple] from the prior set of puzzles and/or a
       statement to the effect of, ‚ÄúThus, just bY rearranging

       The switching of columns and/or rows may result in legal
       Sudoku variations but it would likely break the expected
       symmetry of a Sudoku puzzle. For example if the starting
       grid has cell (1,1) filled in with a number, then
       aesthetics dictate that cell (9,9) also be provided. Most
       Sudoku puzzle publishers would frown on a book that had
       asymmetric puzzles. You could still do certain swapping to
       retain symmetry and have more than enough variations, but
       then the next question would solvers notice this and feel
       like every puzzle had about the same solving strategy and
       difficulty? It would be interesting to test.

            It‚Äôs funny, I hadn‚Äôt really paid attention the
            aesthetics of Sudoku before, but you‚Äôre totally right.
            If you look at the initial position of Sudoku as a
            collection of ‚Äúfilled‚Äù squares and ‚Äúempty‚Äù squares
            (ignoring the specific numbers), then it seems like
            the puzzle is supposed to be preserved under a 180
            degree rotation (and ideally under a 90 degree
            rotation as well). That would cut down pretty
            dramatically on the number of possibilities (though
            how many orders of magnitude you lose, I‚Äôm not sure).
            As for the solving question, my pet hypothesis is that
            the different permutations of an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù puzzle would
            actually feel different to solvers, because such
            puzzles permit multiple strategies to solution, and a
            random change is likely to elicit a new strategy from
            you. But I‚Äôd expect that different permutations of a
            ‚Äúhard‚Äù puzzle would feel dully repetitive, because you
            really would be using the same solving strategy over
            and over. But you‚Äôre probably right that an actual
            test would be in order!

                 Similarly, crossword puzzles always have 180
                 degree rotational symmetry, and furthermore are
                 invariably odd squares. This has always been so,
                 but nobody knows why: the diagramless word
                 puzzles they descend from generally used
                 symmetrical shapes, such as squares and diamonds
                 (the first true crossword puzzle was a
                 symmetrical diamond). Cryptic crosswords also
                 have a convention that about half the letters in
                 each word overlap with some other word: in
                 American-style puzzles, of course, all the
                 letters overlap.

       One thing you need to consider is the stabilizer of the
       Sudoku board. Some symmetries might give back the same
       Sudoku. Then you need to divide by the order of the
       stabilizer group to get the actual number of different
       Sudoku boards. It‚Äôs possible that the stabilizer is
       trivial, but this would require some proof.
       [52]Reply ‚Üì

            Yeah, that‚Äôs a good point. My hunch is that the
            ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù Sudoku would have a small stabilizer (maybe
            just the identity) but that you could probably
            construct special cases with much larger stabilizers.
            Merits further thought.

                 I did this calculation a few years back (and came
                 to the same answer, and glibbly skipped over the
                 stabiliser. My feeling is that non-trivial
                 stabilisers are quite rare both in general, and
                 for those puzzles with given clues in a symmetric
                 pattern (as is the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù).
                 I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs possible to get stabilisers
                 bigger than order 2 (a 180 degree rotation being
                 the same thing as a permutation of the symbols)
                 where the puzzle has a unique solution ‚Äì by
                 uniqueness the non trivial stabiliser would also
                 have to preserve the fully solved grid which
                 feels like a fairly unlikely thing to do.

                      Actually, these calculations were all done a
                      few years ago ‚Äì see
                      oku/. The total number of grids was worked
                      out, and the total number of ‚Äúessentially
                      different‚Äù grids ‚Äì and when you divide the
                      first by the second, you get
                      1218935174261.0998‚Ä¶., which is very near
                      your 1218998108160. And the page
                      oku/sudgroup.html works out all the
                      stabilisers ‚Äì it looks like the orders of
                      permutations in the stabiliser must be 1, 2,
                      3, 4, 6 or 9, although perhaps some grids
                      have stabilisers whose size is a product of
                      some of these.

       i wonder about Sudoku too, here are a few things:
       If the puzzle does not have a unique solution then it
       probably is never included in the newspaper or in a puzzle
       book. And I expect that any of the symmetries above would
       never produce a puzzle that did not have a unique solution
       if it started with a unique solution, and conversely no
       symmetry would change a puzzle that had no unique solution
       to one that did.
       There are different ‚Äòdifficulty‚Äô ratings. I wonder how they
       are determined. For example the one in the post seems to
       have a pretty easy rating. I could solve it by just working
       my way through the numbers in a straightforward way.
       I wonder if any of the symmetries of the above puzzle would
       result in a change to the difficulty level.
       I think the answer is no.
       I‚Äôve read different strategies and some are most definitely
       more complex than just looking at the numbers in turn and
       filling in the obvious choices.
       [63]Reply ‚Üì

            The symmetric puzzle would have the exact same clues
            to solve it and so should be the exact same
            difficulty. From one point of view it is the same
            puzzle. It just looks different.
            Regarding unique solutions, it is a tactic to assume
            that there is a unique solution. There are times where
            the choice of a number to go in one box would leave
            you in a place were it will be impossible to find a
            unique solution. And since we assume there is a unique
            solution we can reject that choice.

       When I first read ‚Äúdifferent ways to play the same Sudoko‚Äù
       I was thinking about a different kind of variation. Instead
       of considering how you can shuffle the starting,
       non-filled-in Sudoku, I was thinking about how many
       different puzzles you can make given one solution. That‚Äôs
       not really enough to well define the question, I guess; a
       Sudoko with just one cell blank shouldn‚Äôt count. But

       I fill in very few random numbers, and find a solution of
       this Sudoku ‚Äúproblem‚Äù. I then remove numbers from the
       solution until it gets non-unique. Surprisingly, this is

       This makes me wonder: if roughly 10^12 puzzles can be
       generated from any puzzle, how many unique puzzles are
       there? I.e., given the space of all Sudoku puzzles, how
       many seed puzzles (or archetypes, or whatever you want to
