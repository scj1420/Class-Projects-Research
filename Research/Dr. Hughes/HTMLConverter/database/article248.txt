[15]The Difference Between Math and Modeling with Math in Five
Seconds


   By [16]Dan Meyer • March 9, 2017 • [17]31 Comments


   [18]Jim Pardun sent me [19]a video of a dog named Twinkie
   popping balloons in the pursuit of a world record. How you
   train a dog to do this, I don’t know. How there is a world
   record for this, I don’t know either.




   What I know is that this video clearly illustrates the
   difference between math and modeling with math.

   [21]You can’t break math. Some people think they broke math but
   all they did was break ground on [22]new disciplines in math
   where, for example, triangles can have more than 180° and
   parallel lines can meet.


   Our mathematical models, by contrast, arrive broken. “All
   models are wrong,” [23]said George Box, “but some are useful.”
   And we see that in this video.


   Twinkie pops 25 balloons in 5 seconds. How long will it take
   her to pop all 100 balloons? A purely mathematical answer is 20
   seconds. That’s straightforward proportional reasoning.

   But mathematical modeling is less than straightforward. It
   requires the re-interpretation of that answer through the
   world’s imperfections. The student who can quickly and
   confidently calculate 20 seconds may even be worse off here
   than the student who patiently thinks about how the supply of
   balloons is dwindling, adds time, and arrives at the actual
   answer of 37 seconds.

   Feel free to show your classes that [24]question video,
   discuss, and then show them the [25]answer video. Or if your
   class has access to devices, you can assign [26]this Desmos
   activity, where we’ll invite them to sketch what they think
   happens over time as well.


   The difference between the students who answer “20 seconds” and
   “37 seconds” is the same difference between the students who
   draw Sketch 1 and Sketch 2.

   You might think you know how your students will sort into those
   two groups, but I hope you’ll be surprised.

   That difference is the patience that modeling with math
   requires.

   BTW. I’m very interested in situations like these where the
   world subverts what seems like a straightforward application of
   a mathematical model.

   One more example is the story of [27]St. Matthew Island, which
   dumps the expectations of pure mathematics on its head at least
   twice.


   Do you have any to trade?
