   Mathematicians at The University of Texas at Arlington are
   conducting research to refine and supplement curriculum
   materials used in college mathematics courses designed for
   students who plan to become high school math teachers.

   The project specifically aims to enhance materials currently
   used in UTeach Arlington, UTA's version of the highly
   successful science and mathematics secondary teacher
   preparation program which has been replicated at 43
   universities across the United States. More than one third of
   UTeach nationwide is comprised of students historically
   underrepresented in science technology, engineering and
   mathematics courses.

   "This project will impact the learning experiences of hundreds
   of thousands of socioeconomically disadvantaged students across
   the country, as 66 percent of UTeach program graduates
   nationwide go on to teach in schools where the majority of
   students are low-income," said James Epperson, UTA associate
   professor of mathematics and leader of the project. "In
   addition, we will not limit dissemination to UTeach programs,
   so the project has the potential to impact an even larger and
   more diverse group of teachers and their students."

   The project is supported by a $300,000 grant from the National
   Science Foundation's Division of Undergraduate Education, with
   Theresa Jorgensen, associate professor of mathematics, and
   Kathryn Rhoads, visiting assistant professor of mathematics,
   participating as co-principal investigators.

   The focus of the project is MATH 2330 or Functions and Modeling
   -- a course taken by all UTeach mathematics majors who are
   seeking teacher certification in mathematics. To increase K-12
   students' interest and success in mathematics, teachers need to
   have a thorough understanding of the mathematics they teach.
   However, research has shown that many secondary school
   mathematics teachers lack a deep understanding of some of the
   mathematical concepts they teach, in part because many
   undergraduate mathematics courses do not offer opportunities
   for teachers to deeply study these concepts. There are few
   curricular resources available for use in college mathematics
   courses designed to train future secondary mathematics
   teachers.

   "This project is important because we aim to develop course
   materials in ways that can deepen teachers' understanding of
   the mathematics they will teach; hence the project has the
   potential to positively impact both secondary school
   mathematics teachers and, in turn, the students they teach,"
   Rhoads said.

   As a first step for the project, the UTA mathematicians brought
   in a prestigious group of math education research and
   practitioner experts in mid-July to provide feedback on the
   current course materials, including Olive Chapman, board member
   for the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and editor
   of the Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education; Elizabeth
   Burroughs, chair of the Mathematical Association of America's
   committee on the Mathematical Education of Teachers; and
   Jennifer Hylemon, K-12 director of mathematics at
   Grapevine-Colleyville ISD and vice-president of the Board of
   Directors for the Conference for the Advancement of Mathematics
   Teaching.

   "This will help us identify the most important research-based
   aspects on teachers' understandings of functions that need to
   be addressed in addition to those already identified by me in
   preliminary pilot classroom studies after having taught from
   the materials three times," Epperson said. "These materials
   have been used at all 43 UTeach institutions and all sites are
   required to use them in their first year of implementation.
   Many universities continue to use the materials and our
   project, once finalized, will be a natural starting point for
   dissemination nationwide across the UTeach network."

   The researchers are using feedback received from the panel of
   experts to make small changes for implementation this fall as
   well as to create an assessment that will provide information
   regarding the effectiveness of the materials at addressing key
   concepts, Epperson said. This fall they will collect data and
   then analyze the data next spring to begin making
   research-based changes to the materials. An advisory board
   composed of math education researchers and school supervisor
   leaders, UTeach Institute representatives and others, will
   guide the external evaluation of products developed by the
   researchers.

   "After feedback is received, changes will be made next summer
   and the process will repeat in Fall 2017," Epperson said. "In
   Spring 2018, after analyzing all data collected, we will again
   revise and create materials as well as draft the instructor
   notes. In Fall 2018, we will study the use of the materials at
   various sites as well as study how a novice instructor uses the
   materials. These materials focus on inquiry-based learning;
   many instructors have never learned in this type of setting and
   may not know how to implement mathematical tasks and
   explorations that are meant to be used in this manner."


   The project builds upon curriculum development and research
   which Epperson has conducted for the last two decades. The
   creation of research- and standards-based materials has a
   natural connection to recent joint work by Epperson and Rhoads
   on high-yield mathematical tasks for teachers, as well as to
   research conducted by Epperson on strengthening problem solving
   for in-service mathematics teachers, and to work done by
   Jorgensen and Epperson as part of UTA's Mathematics Teacher
   Preparation Academy.

   Epperson earned his doctorate in mathematics from UT Austin in
   1996 and came to UTA in 2001. He received the UTA Innovation in
   Teaching Award in 2009 and the UTA Provost's Research
   Excellence Award each year from 2005-10. He is a recipient of
   the UT System Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award in 2010 and
   the Mathematical Association of America Texas Section Award for
   Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics in
   2012, and he was named to the UTA Academy of Distinguished
   Teachers in 2012.

   Jorgensen earned her doctorate in mathematics from the
   University of Nebraska at Lincoln in 2000 and came to UTA in
   2002. She received the UTA Provost's Award for Excellence in
   Teaching in 2005, the UTA Honors College Distinguished Faculty
   Award in 2006, and the UT System Regents' Outstanding Teaching
   Award in 2010. She was named a member of the UTA Academy of
   Distinguished Teachers in 2016.

   Rhoads earned her doctorate in education from Rutgers
   University in 2014 and came to UTA as a visiting assistant
   professor that same year. She has conducted extensive research
   in mathematics education, including ongoing projects funded by
   the NSF and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board which
   focus on mathematical problem solving and representational
   connections in algebraic reasoning.
