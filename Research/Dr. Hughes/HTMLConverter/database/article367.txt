      News Release 16-134

   After two-year decline, postdoc employment at federally funded labs
   increases

   2015 number still below peak employment, but signals rebound
   after losses

     Employment at an FFRDC like Lawrence Livermore National Lab
              provides valuable postdoctoral training.

   The number of postdoctoral researchers employed at federally
   funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) rose to 2,696
   in 2015, the first increase seen after two consecutive years of
   declines, according to a new [95]report from the National
   Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES).


   The total is higher than the previous survey year's 2,613,
   although still lower than the peak of 3,011 reported in 2010.
   Postdoctoral researchers, or postdocs, are individuals who hold
   doctoral degrees and are engaged in research intended to
   further their education and experience. Postdocs are a vital
   part of the nation's next generation of scientists and
   engineers, and employment at FFRDCs provides them with valuable
   training opportunities.

   The share of postdocs on temporary visas at FFRDCs has
   decreased over the past decade, going from 61.5 percent in 2005
   to 53.8 percent in 2015. However, FFRDCs still employ more
   postdocs with temporary visas than with U.S. citizenship or
   permanent resident visas - 1,450 versus 1,246.

   Men still make up the majority of postdocs at FFRDCs, although
   the share of women has increased from 21 percent in 2005 to 24
   percent in 2015.

   Postdocs in FFRDCs performed research in a wide range of fields
   in 2015, including:

   In 2015, 24 of the 42 FFRDCs employed postdocs. Two of them --
   Lincoln Laboratory and Project Air Force -- reported opening
   new postdoc programs that year.

   For more information, including the number of postdocs employed
   at each FFRDC and a detailed list of postdoc fields of
   research, read the full [96]report.

   The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal
   agency that supports fundamental research and education across
   all fields of science and engineering. In fiscal year (FY)
   2017, its budget is $7.5 billion. NSF funds reach all 50 states
   through grants to nearly 2,000 colleges, universities and other
   institutions. Each year, NSF receives more than 48,000
   competitive proposals for funding and makes about 12,000 new
   funding awards.
