   The third edition of this book is very different from the
   previous ones. As the reviews of the [309]first and [310]second
   editions indicate, Rotman is a very good writer. Those editions
   were masterful reference works presenting most of
   graduate-level algebra. Indeed, the second edition served as
   one of my go-to books as I was writing my [311]Guide to Groups,
   Rings, and Fields. I often found that Rotman presented the
   material better than his competitors.


   Clearly, however, the author has felt some restlessness about
   his book. Between the first and second editions, there was a
   change in publisher and also various additions, but there was
   also a significant “I changed my mind” move: instead of
   including a review of basic abstract algebra, Rotman decided to
   point to his undergraduate textbook. The additions made the
   second edition quite big (“elephantine”, he says in the preface
   to the third edition), so it is not surprising that the third
   edition comes in two volumes. More surprising, however, is the
   radical reorganization.

   Where the second edition is clearly a reference book, an
   encyclopedic account of modern algebra to which one might turn
   to recall a theorem or learn a particular topic, the third
   edition is clearly intended as a textbook. It is divided into
   two parts labeled “Course I” and “Course II”, which apparently
   correspond to the first and second graduate courses in algebra
   at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

   Course I has Galois Theory as its telos: it opens with the
   classical formulas for solving cubics and quartics, then goes
   on to cover some number theory and commutative algebra, the
   basics of group theory, and finally Galois Theory itself. It is
   certainly a good choice for a first graduate course, since most
   undergraduates are taught some algebra but many do not see
   Galois Theory, whose theorems are seductive enough to motivate
   what is essentially a review, at greater depth, of
   undergraduate algebra.

   Course II is a course on ring theory, both commutative and
   non-commutative, but mostly commutative. “Having lured students
   into beautiful algebra,” says Rotman, they will now want to
   learn more. This section includes both linear and multilinear
   algebra, some category theory, and some commutative algebra.

   Part 2 of the book has not yet appeared, but the author
   describes it thus:

     These two courses serve as joint prerequisites for the
     forthcoming Part 2, which will present more advanced topics
     in ring theory, group theory, algebraic number theory,
     homological algebra, representation theory, and algebraic
     geometry.

   This leads me to think that it is likely to be more in the
   style of the second edition.

   Rotman is a wonderful expositor, and the two courses in this
   book strike me as well thought out and well presented. (There’s
   too much material, as usual, so that instructors can be
   selective.) But I miss the compendious approach of the second
   edition, in which topics could be developed according to their
   own internal logic rather than the logic imposed by pedagogy.
   I’ll certainly use and learn from this edition, but I think I’m
   going to hold on to my copy of the second edition as well.
