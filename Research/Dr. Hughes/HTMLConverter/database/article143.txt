   Here are two approaches to teaching zero exponents that are
   worth comparing and contrasting:

   First, [19]a Virtual Nerd video:


     Once you have your non-zero number or variable picked out,
     put it to the zero power. Now no matter what number or
     variable you picked, once you put it to the zero power, I
     know what the answer is. One. How do I know this? Well in
     math, if we put any non-zero number or variable to the zero
     power it always equals one. No matter what.

   Second, [20]Cathy Yenca’s activity, which has students
   completing the following table:

   One approach will lead students to understand that math is a
   fragile set of rules that have to be transmitted and validated
   by adults. The other will help students realize that these
   rules are strong and flexible, and exist to make math
   internally coherent, with or without any adults around.

   BTW. This is as good a time as any to re-mention [22]Nix the
   Tricks, the MTBOS’s collection of meaningless math tricks and
   great strategies for teaching those concepts with meaning
   instead.


   BTW. Check out [23]Cathy Yenca’s own post on the comparison.


   BTW. Check out [24]the comments on that YouTube video.
   Interesting, right? What do we do with that?

     I wrote a story about this exact moment in my book. Cliffs
     notes version: 8th grade. Mr. Davis told us the rule a^0=1.
     I questioned why. “Because that’s the rule.” I said, “But
     why?” Stern voice now. “Because that’s what’s I just told
     you.” The first boy I’d ever kissed said, “Give it up T!
     It’s in the book, that’s why!” Everybody laughed. Me too, on
     the outside. Not on the inside. On the inside I was angry
     and frustrated and humiliated. If I write my math
     autobiography, this moment goes in it. It’s one of the
     moments math lost me.

     By the way, my favorite way to see the pattern Cathy shows
     here is with Cuisinaire rods. You literally go from cubes to
     squares to rods to single unit squares. It’s this amazing
     moment to see one as the fundamental unit.

     But I didn’t get to see that in 8th grade. I didn’t see that
     until my late 30s.

     The saddest part? Most kids don’t try again after they’re
     burned. They never come back. The
     not-quite-saddest-part-but-still-sad-part? I doubt Mr. Davis
     ever learned why either.

     That’s the biggest legacy of that story to me, as a teacher.
     How do we handle the moment when it becomes clear, in front
     of the class, that we don’t understand some math we thought
     we understood? Do we handle it like Mr. Davis did, and view
     kids’ questions as challenges to our expertise and
     authority? Or do we say, “You know, your question is making
     me realize I don’t understand this as deeply as I thought I
     did. That’s awesome, because now I get to learn something.
     Let’s figure it out together.”

   [26]Kent Haines:

     Something that has been effective for me (that I mention in
     the video above) is to really emphasize that 1 is the origin
     and invisible starting point of all multiplication problems.

   [27]Scott Farrand offers another helpful way for students to
   make sense of zero exponents:

     There’s a truly great old lesson on exponentiation that I
     believe comes from Project SEED, that has been used with
     amazing success in hundreds of elementary classrooms.

   [28]education realist brings up [29]a Ben Orlin post that
   includes a) a beautiful technique for teaching lots of rules of
   exponentiation and b) this beautiful paragraph:


     Math’s saving grace, though, is that it can make us feel
     smart for another reason: because we’ve mastered an ancient,
     powerful craft. Because we’ve laid down rails of logic, and
     guided a train of thought smoothly to its destination.
     Because we’re masters—not over our peers, but over the deep
     patterns of the universe itself.
