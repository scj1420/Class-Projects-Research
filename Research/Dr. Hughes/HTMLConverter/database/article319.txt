       Many thanks to Matt Simonson for his year as
       Editor-in-Chief. The blog has prospered under his excellent
       leadership and is now regularly excerpted in Notices of the
       American Mathematical Society.

       It’s a little weird to point out that Sarah Salmon is
       female.

            Thanks for catching that. I meant to write first
            female editor-in-chief. Fixed it.
