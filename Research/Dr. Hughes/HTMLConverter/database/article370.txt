A Few of My Favorite Spaces: The Menger Sponge

   It’s not quite two-dimensional, it’s not quite
   three-dimensional. Welcome to the weird world of fractal
   dimension

   I packed up my office recently, so some mathematical objects
   came home with me: a [36]house with two rooms, an [37]origami
   counterexample, some [38]British objects of constant width. And
   then there were the leftovers from that time we built a Menger
   sponge.

   Thanks to [39]Megamenger, a worldwide effort to build a huge
   fractal distributed around the globe, the Menger sponge will
   always be one of [40]my favorite fractals. You can make a
   Menger sponge by taking a solid cube and drilling a square hole
   through the center of one face through to the other side. Now
   do this twice more for the remaining faces. (Worried about
   drilling a square hole? [41]A Reuleaux triangle will come in
   handy.) You’ve now completed one level of the Menger sponge,
   and you’re left with something that looks like a Rubik’s cube
   with a bunch of cubes removed.


   To keep Menger-izing, you drill square holes into all the
   remaining cubes the same way you did the first one. Then drill
   square holes into the remaining cubes, and so on. Like the
   [42]Cantor set or [43]Wallis sieve, which I’ve written about
   earlier, the only barrier to actually making this object in the
   real world is that you have to repeat the construction process
   forever.

   In Megamenger, instead of making the object by drilling and
   removing, each group built it from the ground up. We made 20
   small cubes out of six business cards each, assembled them into
   one holey cube, and took 20 of those to make a larger cube.
   Assembly details are available on the [46]Megamenger site.

   The reason I wanted to write about the Menger sponge right now
   is because it is 2.7268(ish)-dimensional. Earlier this month
   [47]I wrote about dimensions. You can read my post about it,
   but the basic idea was to link dimension to the number of
   coordinates used to measure or label something. That kind of
   dimension is always a whole number. Fractals do have
   dimensionality in the traditional sense, but they are such
   puzzling creatures that people had to come up with a new
   definition of dimension to fully describe them.


   Here’s the problem: the Menger sponge has infinite surface area
   but zero volume. It’s too big if we measure it in two
   dimensions but too small if we measure it in three dimensions.
   In contrast, let’s think about a 1×1 solid square in the
   two-dimensional plane. Its length is infinite: there are
   infinitely many 1-unit line segments that are part of this
   square. Its area is 1 square unit, and its volume is 0 because
   it has no depth. In this example, there’s one dimension in
   which it has infinite size, one dimension in which it has zero
   size, and one dimension in which it has a measurable size. It’s
   like Goldilocks. The two-dimensional plane is “just right” for
   measuring a solid square.

   In the case of the Menger sponge, two-dimensional space is too
   small, and three-dimensional space is too large. Could there be
   some number in between there that is “just right” for the
   Menger sponge?

   There is! To figure out how to find it, we need to be creative
   about how we think about dimension. What features other than
   the number of coordinates define dimension? One is scaling. At
   the risk of being Captain Obvious, let’s start small. In
   one-dimensional space, if you triple an object’s length, the
   object becomes three times as long. In two-dimensional space,
   if you triple an object’s length in every direction—for
   example, tripling the length and width of a rectangle—the
   object becomes nine times as large. Equivalently, it takes nine
   small squares to make one square with triple the side length.
   In three dimensions, if you triple the length, width, and
   height of a cube, it becomes 27 times as large. It takes 27
   small cubes to make one cube with triple the side length. We
   can see a pattern here. The numbers 3, 9, 27 can also be
   written 3^1, 3^2, 3^3—the dimension is the power to which we
   raise the scale factor to get the new size.

   Now we can see why the Menger sponge doesn’t  quite work as
   either a two-dimensional or a three-dimensional object. When we
   stretch each side of the Menger sponge by a factor of three, we
   get 20 copies of the Menger sponge back, so we have multiplied
   its size by 20. Another way to think about it is that it only
   takes 20 cubes to build a level-one Menger sponge and 20
   level-ones to build a level-two. But the level-two Menger
   sponge’s sides are three times as long as the level-one’s.

   Because we can raise numbers to non-integer powers, we can use
   scaling to understand what dimension might mean for objects
   like the Menger sponge that don’t scale the way whole
   number-dimensional objects like a solid cube do. The dimension
   is the power to which we raise the scale factor to get the new
   size. For the Menger sponge, its dimension d is the number that
   solves the equation 3^d=20. The number 2.7268 just about does
   it. (The exact answer is log[3]20 or log(20)/log(3).)


   It would be a shame to leave a post about the Menger sponge and
   fractal dimension without a rabbit-hole for you to dive down,
   so here you go: the [48]Wikipedia list of fractals by
   dimension. You’re welcome!
