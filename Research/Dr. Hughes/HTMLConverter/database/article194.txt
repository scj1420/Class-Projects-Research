   Summary:
          How do forensic scientists deal with complex
          DNA-evidence found at crime scenes? A researcher has now
          developed new statistical models to analyze them.

   DNA-evidence is often believed to be a damning evidence, which
   leaves no space for uncertainty. In reality it is very
   difficult to say to what degree some piece of evidence can
   support a case against a crime suspect. That's why forensic
   experts need statistical models to give weight to DNA-evidence.
   PhD-candidate Giulia Cereda developed new models that will be
   especially useful for rare DNA-profiles in the evidence, and
   for unbalanced DNA-mixtures.

   Rare type match case

   When a DNA-profile found at a crime scene matches a suspect's
   DNA-profile, it is important to know how frequent this profile
   can be found in the general population. For example, the
   evidence weights more if a suspect's DNA-profile matches only
   two other persons in the general population, compared to a
   hundred other persons. Since forensic scientists don't have the
   DNA-profiles of all individuals, they use databases that
   contain DNA-profiles of a sample of the population.

   But often forensic scientists find DNA-profiles that don't
   match one of the profiles in the database, which is called a
   rare type match case. Cereda developed several statistical
   models to deal with these cases.

   Unbalanced DNA-mixtures

   Another common difficulty when handling DNA-evidence are
   mixtures, which contain DNA-material from at least two people.
   'When the DNA of two individuals are mixed together, it is very
   difficult to separate the DNA-profiles of the two
   contributors', Cereda says.

   DNA-mixtures can be even more complicated when they are
   unbalanced. These mixtures are often found in cases of sexual
   assault, when vaginal swabs are taken. In these cases, the
   victim's DNA contributes for more than 90% to the DNA-mixture,
   while the suspect's DNA contributes to less than 10%. In these
   mixtures, the DNA-profile of the suspect is likely to be masked
   by that of the victim.

   DIP-STR

   A new genetic technology to characterize unbalanced
   DNA-evidence, called the DIP-STR (Deletion Insertion
   polymorphisms -- Short Tandem Repeats) marker system, has
   recently been introduced. DIP-STR reveals some DNA
   characteristics of the minor contributor in unbalanced
   mixtures. With her new model, Cereda wants to give a first
   statistical framework to evaluate the DIP-STR DNA-profiles.

   Statistics and genetics

   'The use of accurate mathematical models for forensic DNA
   evidence is very important to give probabilistic weight to
   observation. Geneticists and mathematicians need to work
   together to improve forensic science', she concludes.
