      Mathematician Applies Complex Equations to Curious Phenomena

   Why do flags flutter? Why do some leaves have serrated edges?
   Why is a pattern left behind when muddy water evaporates? Those
   are just a few of the burning questions [40]Lakshminarayanan
   Mahadevan has dedicated his life to answering. A professor of
   applied mathematics at Harvard University, he seeks to explain
   the mundane details of the world that most of us take for
   granted. “It’s work no self-respecting experimentalist would
   do,” he says.


   Mahadevan starts by creating a mathematical model of something
   — how a Venus flytrap snaps shut so quickly, for instance —
   then examines the thing in his laboratory to see if his
   equations are accurate. Usually they aren’t, forcing him to
   look deeper. “Most questions that are easy to ask are very
   difficult to answer,” he says.

   These quirky experiments may have practical applications: His
   study of how honey drips, for example, could help geologists
   studying magma. But that’s the last thing on his mind. “I’m
   happy just to have my curiosity satisfied, if only
   temporarily.”

   In September, Mahadevan’s research garnered a $500,000
   MacArthur “genius” grant. How will the money change him? “Now,”
   he says with a chuckle, “I can fail in even more spectacular
   ways.”
