Mathematical Treasure: De Morgan’s Probability for Insurers

   Author(s):
   Frank J. Swetz (The Pennsylvania State University)

   [308]Augustus De Morgan (1806-1871) was a British mathematician
   and logician. He was a versatile contributor to mathematics
   with many published works. One of these works specifically
   written for the growing British insurance business was An Essay
   on Probabilities and their Application to Life Contingencies
   and Insurance Offices (1838). The illustration on the title
   page features a young woman (the muse of business and trade?)
   sitting on wares to be shipped and looking out to sea and its
   perils.


   In the first five pages of his Preface, De Morgan presented a
   brief history of the development of the mathematics of
   probability and its applications.
