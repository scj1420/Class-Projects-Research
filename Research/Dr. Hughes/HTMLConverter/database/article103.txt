Celebrating Black Mathematicians

   The first four mathematicians featured on the Mathematically
   Gifted and Black website: Trachette Jackson, Arlie Petters,
   Tasha Innis, and Mohamed Omar.

   As you may know, February is Black History Month in the U.S. To
   celebrate, the new website [17]Mathematically Gifted and Black
   is featuring a different black mathematician every day this
   month. The site was started by mathematicians Erica Graham,
   Raegan Higgins, Candice Price, and Shelby Wilson, who were
   inspired by [18]Lathisms, a similar project featuring Latinx
   and Hispanic mathematicians in September and October. (I wrote
   about that project [19]here in October.) As they write in their
   mission statement,


     Our mission is to feature and share the accomplishments of
     blacks in the mathematical sciences. The mathematicians
     highlighted here have made significant contributions in
     research, mentoring, and teaching. This platform provides
     access to the diverse and dynamic community of black
     mathematicians.

   So far I’ve seen two familiar faces and four new ones on the
   calendar, and I’m looking forward to seeing who else pops up
   this month. You can suggest people for next year by
   [20]emailing the organizers. Price, Wilson, Syvillia Averett,
   and Dandrielle Lewis are also making short videos about black
   mathematicians and posting one each Sunday this month. [21]The
   first one is here.

   The runaway success of the movie Hidden Figures, which brings
   to light the work black women did in the early days of NASA in
   spite of racist and sexist barriers they faced, makes me
   optimistic that more people want to learn about people like
   Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson. I know
   the movie has been a source of [23]inspiration for [24]teachers
   who want to get their students excited about math and science
   and broaden their perspective on who mathematicians and
   scientists are. Sites like [25]Mathematically Gifted and Black
   and this [26]Marie Claire article about black women currently
   working at NASA are also good places to meet more people who
   follow in that legacy.
