   This is a text for an upper-level undergraduate course in
   abstract algebra. In both topic coverage and method of
   presentation, the book is on the more sophisticated end of the
   spectrum.

   As to topic coverage: there is more than enough material in
   this text for a two-semester course. All the usual topics that
   one might expect to find in a two-semester course are certainly
   here, but there is also quite a bit more. The book covers basic
   set theory (functions, equivalence relations, etc.), number
   theory of the integers (divisibility, prime factorization,
   congruences), groups (quotient groups, group actions, Sylow
   theory, solvable and nilpotent groups) and rings and fields
   (rings and ideals, factorization theory, field extensions,
   finite fields, Galois theory). Nice applications of these ideas
   (e.g., compass and straightedge constructions, solution of
   polynomials by radicals, coding theory) are also given. There
   are also chapters on vector spaces (including some topics that
   don’t often get covered in introductory linear algebra courses,
   like dual spaces and triangularization of matrices), modules
   (including modules over a PID, with applications to the
   rational, Smith and Jordan forms of a matrix), and tensor
   products.

   The chapters on modules and tensor products cover topics that I
   would think are rarely reached in the first two semesters of an
   undergraduate abstract algebra course. Even in those chapters
   that do correspond to topics generally associated with
   introductory abstract algebra courses, the material is
   sometimes covered in greater depth than usual. For example,
   chapter 3, introducing groups, also discusses the principle of
   inclusion-exclusion and derangements; chapter 11 on fields
   covers Latin squares and Steiner triple systems. Another
   unusual feature, at least at the undergraduate level, is a
   proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra that uses Sylow and
   Galois theory and the intermediate value theorem of calculus.
   The necessary and sufficient condition for the constructability
   of a regular n-gon (in terms of Fermat primes) is not only
   stated but proved. Zorn’s Lemma is introduced at the end of the
   book and applications of it (the existence of an algebraic
   closure, the existence of a basis for an arbitrary vector
   space, the existence of maximal ideals in rings with identity)
   are discussed.

   As for the method of presentation: the author’s writing style
   is clear and enjoyable to read, but it is also brisk and
   efficient. The discussion of basic number theory, for example,
   takes all of 14 pages, and it takes the author only about 65
   pages to cover a first semester’s worth of group theory.
   (Actually, these 65 pages cover more than the standard
   introductory topics; they include coverage of group actions and
   Sylow theory as well, topics that are often deferred to a
   second course.) The introductory chapter on rings goes from the
   definition of “ring” on page 100 to a statement and proof of
   the Hilbert basis theorem on page 118. This is, therefore, not
   a book for students who need a great deal of hand-holding.

   The exercises are good; around ten of them (give or take a few)
   appear at the end of every section (not chapter), and cover a
   reasonable range of difficulty. Simple verification problems
   (is such-and-such a group?) appear, but so do more conceptual
   problems asking for proofs. Based on a quick perusal, I didn’t
   notice any that appear inordinately difficult. No solutions are
   provided, but sometimes the author offers a hint.

   To summarize and conclude: because of the choice of topics
   covered and the succinctness of exposition, this book is
   probably not an optimal choice as text for an “average”
   introductory course in abstract algebra. At the same time,
   because it omits a lot of graduate-level topics (group
   representation theory, noncommutative ring theory, categories
   and functors, projective and injective modules, etc.) this book
   likely will not replace such standard fare as Dummit and
   Foote’s [309]Abstract Algebra as a text for a first-year
   graduate course. It is, however, a nicely done book, and might
   function well as a text for an honors course or an
   undergraduate course at an elite university. I would also
   recommend it to a student who was planning to go on to graduate
   school and wanted to do some independent reading to help
   prepare for that.
