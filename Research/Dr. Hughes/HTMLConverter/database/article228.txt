[240]Now Algorithms Are Deciding Whom To Hire, Based On Voice


   Rebecca MacKinnon, director of the Ranking Digital Rights
   project at New America: "Algorithms driven by machine learning
   quickly become opaque even to their creators who no longer
   understand the logic being followed to make certain decisions
   or produce certain results. The lack of accountability and
   complete opacity is frightening. On the other hand, algorithms
   have revolutionized humans' relationship with information in
   ways that have been life-saving and empowering and will
   continue to do so."

   Jason Hong, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon
   University: "The old adage of garbage in, garbage out still
   applies, but the sheer quantity of data and the speed of
   computers might give the false impression of correctness. As a
   trivial example, there are stories of people following GPS too
   closely and ending up driving into a river."

   Amali De Silva-Mitchell, a futurist and consultant: "Predictive
   modeling will limit individual self-expression hence innovation
   and development. It will cultivate a spoon-fed population with
   those in the elite being the innovators. There will be a loss
   in complex decision-making skills of the masses."

   Marina Gorbis, executive director at the Institute for the
   Future: "Imagine instead of typing search words and getting a
   list of articles, pushing a button and getting a narrative
   paper on a specific topic of interest. It's the equivalent of
   each one of us having many research and other assistants. ...
   Algorithms also have the potential to uncover current biases in
   hiring, job descriptions and other text information."
