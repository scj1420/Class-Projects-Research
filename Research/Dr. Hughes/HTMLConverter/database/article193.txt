   [3]What are some daily life problems with a simple mathematical
   or algorithmic solution? originally appeared on [4]Quora: the
   knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are
   answered by people with unique insights.


   [5]Answer by [6]Alon Amit, Co-founder and VP Product at
   [7]Origami Logic, on [8]Quora:


   Coins: Just flip the coin twice and call HH=1, HT=2, TH=3 and
   if you get two tails, try again.

   Cakes: A reasonably realistic scenario is the cake-cutting
   challenge, where two people want to share a cake but
   potentially disagree on the good parts (one likes the pink
   icing, the other is a fan of the unevenly-distributed chocolate
   cream). A well-known game-theoretic solution has one person cut
   the cake and the other person choose one of the pieces; the
   first person should cut it as evenly as she can so she doesn't
   really mind which half she gets, and then the second person can
   obviously choose a half he's satisfied with. There are similar
   (but significantly more complex) protocols for three or more
   people.

   Lines: Suppose you need to draw a straight line between points
   A and B, but your ruler is too short. You can easily use the
   short ruler to draw a really long straight line by sliding it
   along and extending the line repeatedly, but how do you make it
   hit point B if your aim isn't perfect as you start from A?

   Here's how: The lines 1 and 2 are failed attempts which
   nevertheless make it pretty close to B. Now you can draw the
   lines 3, 4, 5 (randomly, but emanating from one point) and then
   follow the criss-crossing pattern to find the point C which is
   hopefully close enough to B so you can use the short ruler to
   connect BC and extend it all the way to A—yes, it's now
   guaranteed to hit.

   Square Holes: If you absolutely must drill one, there's always
   the Reuleaux Triangle.

   Said triangle is of course useful also when you must construct
   a few logs to smoothly support some rolling platform but,
   incredibly, local religion prohibits the use of anything
   circular.

   Salaries: You and a bunch of similarly inclined geeks wish to
   figure out what your average monthly salary is, without
   revealing anything about your individual ones beyond what can
   be learned from knowing the average. If there's just two of you
   this is pointless, but if there's, say, ten of you (a party?),
   here's what you could do: Sit around in a circle. First person
   chooses a random number between zero and a billion, adds her
   own salary, writes the result on a piece of paper and passes it
   on to the next guy. He adds his own salary and passes that on
   to the next person (just the new sum, with no trace of the
   original number he saw. Shred that.). And so on, everyone adds
   their own salary to the (likely) huge and meaningless number
   being passed around, until the first person gets the total
   back. She then subtracts her original random number and
   announces the sum, which you can then divide by the number of
   people to get the average. Other than that average, you've
   learned nothing.

   Padlocks: You wish to send your sweetheart a diamond ring but
   you're nervous it will be stolen by someone along the way if
   you don't put it in a locked box. You have all kinds of locks
   and keys as does your sweetheart, but you can't exchange them
   directly for the same reason. What to do? The standard trick is
   to send the ring in a locked box for which you have the key but
   she doesn't. She therefore can't open it (nor could anyone else
   en route) but she can double-lock it with another padlock of
   her own, and send it back. You unlock your original lock and
   send it to her once again, this time locked just with her
   padlock, which she gleefully opens to retrieve her ring.

   Notes:
       which is itself part of mathematical economics or game
       theory. There's plenty of real-life algorithms to be found
       here.
       from the fields of modern cryptography, communication
       protocols, zero-knowledge proofs, secret sharing and
       fault-tolerant design. Again, plenty of other "mind hacks"
       can be found in this domain.
       other clever geometric constructions that could be deemed
       "real life" under the appropriate circumstances.
       which "Square holes" is just one. A differential is
       another, probably too well known to be mentioned here.
