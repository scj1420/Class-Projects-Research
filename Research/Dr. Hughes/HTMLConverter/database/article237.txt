   Welcome to The Riddler. Every week, I offer up a problem
   related to the things we hold dear around here: math, logic and
   probability. These problems, puzzles and riddles come from many
   top-notch puzzle folks around the world ‚Äî including you!

   Some Riddler Nation news! Starting today, we‚Äôre going to offer
   up the occasional Riddler Express problem. These will be
   bite-size puzzles that don‚Äôt take as much fancy math or
   computational power to solve. For those of you in the
   slow-puzzle movement, worry not ‚Äî we‚Äôll still feature our
   classic, more challenging Riddler. And for those of you who
   have found that Riddler to be a bit too challenging, hopefully
   Riddler Express is more your style.

   You can mull both over on your commute, dissect them on your
   lunch break and argue about them with your friends and lovers.
   When you‚Äôre ready, submit your answer(s) using the links below.
   I‚Äôll reveal the solutions next week, and a correct submission
   (chosen at random) will earn a shoutout in this column.[19]^1

   Before we get to the new puzzles (plural!), let‚Äôs reveal the
   winner of [20]last week‚Äôs. Congratulations to üëè Mark Canning üëè
   of Santa Clara, California, our big winner. You can find a
   solution to the previous Riddler at the bottom of this post.

   But first, the inaugural Riddler Express! This one comes from
   Kevin Huigens:

   Count Von Count, the counting count on ‚ÄúSesame Street,‚Äù counts
   aloud [21]on Twitter. If he counts up by one with each tweet ‚Äî
   ‚ÄúOne!‚Äù ‚ÄúTwo!‚Äù ‚ÄúThree!‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúFive hundred thirty eight!‚Äù etc. ‚Äî
   how high can he go before hitting the 140-character limit?
   Note: The count is enthusiastic and must end all of his tweets
   with an exclamation point.

   And now, for Riddler Classic, a puzzle from Stephen Penrice:

   You are one of 30 team owners in a professional sports league.
   In the past, your league set the order for its annual draft
   using the teams‚Äô records from the previous season ‚Äî the team
   with the worst record got the first draft pick, the team with
   the second-worst record got the next pick, and so on. However,
   due to concerns about teams intentionally losing games to
   improve their picks, the league adopts a modified system. This
   year, each team tosses a coin. All the teams that call their
   coin toss correctly go into Group A, and the teams that lost
   the toss go into Group B. All the Group A teams pick before all
   the Group B teams; within each group, picks are ordered in the
   traditional way, from worst record to best. If your team would
   have picked 10th in the old system, what is your expected draft
   position under the new system?

   Extra credit: Suppose each team is randomly assigned to one of
   T groups where all the teams in Group 1 pick, then all the
   teams in Group 2, and so on. (The coin-flipping scenario above
   is the case where T = 2.) What is the expected draft position
   of the team with the Nth-best record?

   And here‚Äôs the solution to [28]last week‚Äôs Riddler, concerning
   some statisticians who find a $100 bill on the floor. If five
   of them play a game where, each turn, the bill has to do one of
   three things ‚Äî move left, move right, or stay put (at which
   point the game ends) ‚Äî and each thing is equally likely to
   happen, whoever starts with the bill has a 5/11 chance of
   keeping it.


   To get there, we can set up a system of equations. Let \(P_0\)
   be the probability you win when the bill starts in front of
   you, \(P_1\) be the probability if it starts one seat away, and
   \(P_2\) be the probability if it starts two seats away. If you
   start with the bill, for example, your chances of winning this
   turn are 1/3 plus your chances of winning if the bill is one
   seat away, which we can express mathematically like so:

   $$P_0 = 1/3 + P_1/3 + P_1/3$$

   Similarly for the other two possible positions:

   $$P_1 = P_0/3 + P_2/3$$

   $$P_2 = P_1/3 + P_2/3$$

   Then we [29]solve that system algebraically, which gives
   \(P_0=5/11\), \(P_1=2/11\) and \(P_2=1/11\).


   For extra credit, I asked what the chances would be if there
   were N statisticians in the department, rather than five. The
   extra-credit solutions I received drew on all sorts of cool
   approaches, from [30]simulations to [31]Fourier transforms to
   [32]contour integrals.


   The full solution from the puzzle‚Äôs submitter, Bruce Torrence,
   will be published in a forthcoming issue of Mathematics
   Magazine. But simply put, all this fancy math winds up in a
   surprisingly beautiful place. For N players, the chances of
   winning if you start with the $100 bill are

   $$ P_0= \begin{cases} F_N / L_N & \text{if $N$ is odd}\\ L_N /
   5F_N & \text{if $N$ is even}\end{cases}$$

   Where \(F_N\) is the Nth [33]Fibonacci number, and \(L_N\) is
   the Nth [34]Lucas number. The fifth Fibonacci number (not
   counting zero) is 5, and the fifth Lucas number is 11,
   recreating our 5/11 answer above. As the number of players
   increases to infinity, the chances of winning if you start with
   the bill converge to \(1/\sqrt{5}\).
