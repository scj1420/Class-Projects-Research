Mathematical Treasure: Theodoric Luders on Mathematics and
Fortification

   Author(s):
   Frank J. Swetz (The Pennsylvania State University)

   Little is known about Theodoric Luders (born circa 1657) other
   than that he was a prolific author of books concerning the
   applications of mathematics, particularly the mathematics of
   warfare. In his writings, he described himself as a
   mathematician and engineer. His Traicté Mathematique (1680)
   appears to be a rather complete text with its scope including
   Euclidean geometry, decimal arithmetic, and the other branches
   of mathematics listed on its title page. Especially interesting
   is the variety of fortifications described: Dutch, French,
   Italian, and Spanish. The absence of reference to English
   construction is noteworthy.

   applications.

   Luders made use of tables of information to condense his
   presentations, as shown in his discussion of the use of “sine”
   on page 7.

   mathematical applications.

   The form and design of Dutch fortifications were also
   summarized in one table of information.
