   What do Gödel’s incompleteness results tell us about human
   intellectual capacity compared to computer algorithms? Some
   have argued the human intellect is non-algorithmic and that its
   potential exceeds that of any conceivable computer. Gödel
   himself considered the question seriously and he arrived at the
   proposition called Gödel’s disjunction. This states that either
   no algorithm can capture the human mathematical mind or there
   are absolutely undecidable problems.

   Gödel’s argument in support of his disjunction goes as follows.
   Suppose that the human mind is ultimately algorithmic (so there
   is an algorithm that can produce all the theorems that the
   human mind is capable of producing). The Church-Turing thesis
   says that every algorithmically computable function is
   computable with a Turing machine. This is equivalent to the
   proposition that the collection of humanly knowable theorems
   can be recursively axiomatized in some formal theory T. This
   theory would then be consistent. But Gödel’s second
   incompleteness theorem says that consistent theories (that
   contain the basic laws of arithmetic) cannot prove their own
   consistency, even though they can express it by numerical
   encoding. So there will be mathematical propositions P that
   cannot be decided by T. Since T is supposed to capture all that
   is human provable, then these propositions P are humanly —
   hence absolutely — undecidable.

   This argument is widely accepted as compelling by mathematical
   logicians and philosophers of mathematics. Gödel observed that
   the disjunction is not exclusive, and both alternatives could
   be true. He favored the first alternative himself, but he never
   found a way to establish either alternative conclusively. In
   the past some of the best-known arguments have been in favor of
   the human mind’s superiority. These include, in particular,
   Roger Penrose (in two popular books), and John Lucas (in a
   widely cited [309]paper). Most experts now find their arguments
   inadequate.


   This book arose from meetings at the University of Bristol
   where mathematical logicians and mathematical philosophers met
   to consider this and related issues. The collection of articles
   includes eleven papers in three general areas: algorithms,
   formal consistency and human knowability; minds and machines;
   and absolute undecidability. The general aim was to formalize
   some of the central arguments in the debate in order to connect
   the informal notions of human knowability and algorithms with
   mathematical concepts of formal derivability and Turing
   machines.

   An introduction by the editors offers an accessible entry point
   to readers with a basic background in mathematical logic. Many
   of the papers are clearly aimed at experts, but their
   introductory sections are generally written for a broader
   audience.

   The editors do a particularly good job of establishing context
   and background, as well as summarizing the contributions of the
   individual papers. Of all the papers, Peter Koellner’s is
   probably the best analysis of Gödel’s disjunction and also the
   most accessible. Koellner takes a very careful look at Roger
   Penrose’s arguments in favor of the anti-mechanistic view (that
   the capabilities of the human mind exceed that of any Turing
   machine). In the end, he finds them inadequate. The main
   difficulty he finds is with the idea of “idealizing the mind”
   when we do not have a good model of the mind to idealize.
   Koellner concludes with his own dichotomy: either the notions
   of absolute provability and knowability by an idealized human
   are problematic, or there are serious limitations on any
   arguments in favor of human superiority.

   Much of the complication that arises here is the difficulty of
   attaching formal meaning to informal, semi-mathematical ideas.
   What does “ideal human mind” mean, and can it somehow
   incorporate human creativity? “Absolute undecidability” is also
   difficult to pin down. Virtually all the papers in this
   collection aim to formalize some aspect of the problem. One
   that gets a lot of attention is the concept of “knowability”.

   For many mathematicians, questions like the ones considered
   here are either irrelevant or uninteresting. After all,
   virtually all the mathematics most of us care about can be done
   without any consideration of these ideas. Nonetheless, they are
   intriguing even if ultimately frustrating: intriguing because
   they might help us understand more about what it means to be
   human, and frustrating because it is hard to imagine ever
   really resolving the question.
