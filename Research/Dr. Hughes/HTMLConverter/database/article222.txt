Mathematical Treasure: Clebsch’s Lectures on Geometry

   Author(s):
   Frank J. Swetz (The Pennsylvania State University)

   [308]Alfred Clebsch (1833-1872) was a German mathematician
   noted for his work in algebraic geometry as well as his ability
   as a teacher of mathematics. Some of his most important work
   involved Abelian integrals. In 1868, Clebsch accepted the chair
   of mathematics at the University of Göttingen formerly held by
   Riemann. His 1876 Vorlesungen über geometrie [Lectures on
   Geometry] was based on his lecture notes at Göttingen, but
   prepared by his student [309]Ferdinand Lindemann (1852-1939)
   after Clebsch’s death. Lindemann is mainly remembered for his
   proof of the transcendence of the number π.
