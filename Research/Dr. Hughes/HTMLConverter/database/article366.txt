   A fairly esoteric problem book on inequalities, 109
   Inequalities from the AwesomeMath Summer Program lives up to
   its promise as “an instructive resource for students striving
   for success at national and international competitions.”
   AwesomeMath is a mathematical program for aspiring bright
   mathematicians at the middle and high school levels; the
   program is an educational supplement and is tailored
   specifically to competitions such as the USAMO. This problem
   book provides the essential theorems about inequalities,
   various examples, and many problems. The exposition is succinct
   but sufficient; the conciseness may prove challenging at times,
   and much is left for the reader to discover through the
   examples. Thus, the book is valuable to a rigorous student or
   competitor, but unfit for the casual mathematician or reader.

   The heart of a problem book is, of course, the problems. As the
   title suggests, there are 109 problems relating to inequalities
   — 54 introductory problems and 55 advanced problems. Many
   problems and their presented solutions are quite subtle, and
   involve delicate applications of various inequalities. The
   advanced problems are justly named and are quite difficult.
   Overall, the problems form an excellent training regiment for
   mathematical inequalities and will help readers master the
   subject.

   109 Inequalities from the AwesomeMath Summer Program was
   intended for a specific audience — students wishing to perform
   well in mathematical competitions — and it is that audience
   that will glean the most from its contents. It is an excellent
   resource and would be a valuable addition to a problem-solver’s
   library.

   Readers like myself who enjoyed this book may also take
   interest in AwesomeMath’s other publications. The program has
   released problem books on a wide array of mathematical topics.
   Examples include 105 Algebra Problems from the AwesomeMath
   Summer Program and 107 Geometry Problems from the AwesomeMath
   Year-Round Program.
