   Mathematics is full of stories of geniuses toiling away in
   isolation before presenting the world with a monumental result
   that takes years for everyone else to understand. A famous
   example is [17]Fermat's last theorem, a 350-year old problem
   that was solved in the 1990s by [18]Andrew Wiles after years of
   secretive work. Another is the Poincaré conjecture, [19]proved
   in the 2000s by the reclusive Grigory Perelman who later
   refused all reward and recognition for his work.

   This summer the world of number theory made a renewed effort to
   understand another such result, first published in 2012 by the
   mathematician [20]Shinichi Mochizuki. Mochizuki had spent many
   years working in private on a famous problem known as the ABC
   conjecture. His papers, which run to over 500 pages, purport to
   prove the conjecture, but turned out to be impenetrable. There
   were too many new formalisms and too much unfamiliar
   terminology for other mathematicians to handle. Mochizuki
   didn't help by refusing to travel outside of Japan to explain
   his work. A conference that took place in Oxford last December,
   without Mochizuki, failed to elucidate the proof, though it did
   give people a deeper insight into his methods. It wasn't until
   this summer, nearly four years after publishing the papers,
   that Mochizuki offered some more pentrable guidance at a
   conference in Kyoto. And although his proof is far from
   understood, attending mathematicians expressed some hope that
   they will eventually get there.

   The ABC conjecture cuts right to the heart of number theory by
   linking its two most basic operations: addition and
   multiplication. Multiplication is intimately linked to those
   favourite friends of number theorists, the prime numbers.
   Primes are natural numbers that are only divisible by
   themselves and $1.$ Examples are $2$ , $3$ , $5$ , $7$ and
   $11.$ A famous result that was already known to the ancient
   Greeks states that every natural number can be written as a
   product of primes, for example
     \[ 4 = 2 \times 2, \]
     \[ 9 = 3 \times 3, \]

   and
     \[ 12 = 2 \times 2 \times 3. \]

   The result is the reason why multplication and primes go hand
   in hand. For example, if you know the prime factors of two
   numbers $a$ and $b$ , you immediately know the prime factors of
   their product
     \[ c=a \times b. \]

   They are simply the prime factors of $a$ and the prime factors
   of $b$ taken together. As an example, if $a=4=2^2$ and
   $b=9=3^2$ , you immmediately know that the prime factors of the
   product ( $36$ ) are $2$ (twice) and $3$ (twice):
     \[ 4 \times 9 = 2^2 \times 3^2 = 36. \]

   When it comes to addition, though, the primes aren’t quite so
   amenable. Suppose you have three numbers $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ such
   that
     \[ a+b=c. \]

   There’s nothing obvious you can say about the prime factors of
   the three numbers in this case. If $a=4$ and $b=9$ as above,
   then
     \[ c=a+b=13, \]

   which is itself prime. In this case the result of the sum ( $c$
   ) involves a larger prime ( $13$ ) than both $a$ and $b$ (which
   involve primes $2$ and $3$ .) But this isn’t always the case.
   If $a=4$ and $b=5$ then the result of the sum
     \[ c=4+5=9=3^2, \]

   only involves a prime ( $3$ ) that nestles in size between
   those appearing in $a$ and $b$ ( $2$ and $5$ ). Is it possible
   to say anything at all about the primes appearing in $c$
   compared to those appearing in $a$ and $b$ ?

   One way of gauging the size of the primes that divide three
   numbers $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ is to multiply all their prime
   factors together, but only keeping one copy of each. For
   $a=4=2^2,$ $b=5$ and $c=9=3^2$ the prime factors are $2$
   (twice), $5,$ and $3$ (twice). Multiplying them together but
   only using one copy of each gives
     \[ 2\times 3\times 5 = 30. \]
   ABC

   Not quite as easy as ABC.

   Even if you didn’t know what $a,$ $b$ and $c$ were to start
   with, knowing that this product is $30$ would tell you
   immediately that the only prime factors involved in the three
   numbers are $2,$ $3$ and $5.$ The product is called the radical
   of $abc$ and written as $rad(abc).$ You can regard it as a sort
   of average. It doesn’t tell you what the three numbers involved
   are exactly, but it encodes information about the size of their
   prime factors.

   In our example with $a=4,$ $b=5$ and $c=9$ we have
     \[ rad(abc)=2 \times 3 \times 5 = 30. \]

   This radical is bigger than the result $c=9$ of the sum. The
   same goes for the example $a=4$ , $b=9$ and $c=13.$ In this
   case the radical is
     \[ rad(abc) = 2 \times 3\times 13 = 78, \]

   which is again bigger than the result $c=13$ of the sum.
   Playing around with a few more examples will soon lead you to
   suspect that this is always the case.

   This is what the ABC conjecture would like to say. That given a
   triple $a$ , $b$ and $c$ without common factors (because that
   would be boring), and with $a+b=c,$ we always have
     \[ c<rad(abc). \]

   Unfortunately though, this isn’t true. A counter example is
   $a=2$ , $b=243$ and $c=2+243=245$ . The only prime factor of
   $a$ is $2$ , the only prime factor of $243$ is $3$ (since
   $243=3^5$ ) and the prime factors of $245$ are $5$ and $7$
   (since $245=5\times 7^2$ ). The radical is therefore
     \[ rad(abc) = 2 \times 3\times 5\times 7 = 210, \]

   which is smaller than $c=245.$

   So instead, the ABC conjecture says that $c<rad(abc)$ is
   usually true, where the meaning of "usually" is made up of two
   components. The first component relates to the fact that there
   are infinitely many triples $a$ , $b$ and $c$ with no common
   factors (co-prime triples) and with $a+b=c.$ You can easily
   make as many as you like yourself: simply pick two co-prime
   numbers $a$ and $b$ and add them together to get $c$ . The
   "usually" in this context is interpreted as meaning that only a
   finite number of such triples don’t comply with the requirement
   that
     \[ c<rad(abc). \]

   A finite number can still be large of course (think of
   1,000,000) but it would still pale into insignificance compared
   to the infinity of cases that do comply.

   So is it true that only finitely many of the infinite number of
   co-prime triples $a$ , $b$ and $c$ with $a+b=c$ do not have
   $c<rad(abc)$ ? Unfortunately not — it’s possible to find
   infinitely many such triples — which leads to the second
   meaning of the word "usually".

   The other way to create a little leeway is to allow $c$ to be a
   tiny little bit bigger than $rad(abc)$ . Given any positive
   number $r$ , the number
     \[ rad(abc)^{1+r} \]

   is bigger than $rad(abc)$ . For example, if $r=1$ we get
     \[ rad(abc)^{2}, \]

   which is quite a lot bigger than $rad(abc).$ If you take $r$ to
   be really small, for example $r=0.000001,$ then
     \[ rad(abc)^{1+r} \]

   is only a tiny little bit bigger than $rad(abc).$

   Applying this meaning of "usually" and combining it with the
   first meaning gives us the ABC conjecture in its full glory.
   Given any number positive $r$ , which can be as small as you
   like, there are only finitely many co-prime triples $a$ , $b$
   and $c$ with $a+b=c$ that do not have
     \[ c<rad(abc)^{1+r}. \]

   The triples that do not comply depend on the value you choose
   for $r$ . There’ll be more such triples for a smaller $r$ than
   there are for a larger one. But however small or large your $r$
   , if the conjecture is true, you can rest assured that only
   finitely many triples don’t comply.

   The ABC conjecture might not be as easy to explain as Fermat’s
   last theorem, but a proof would be no less exciting. Many other
   important results in number theory would follow from it,
   including Fermat’s last theorem itself. It’s an exciting
   prospect — but it seems we need to wait for a little while
   longer to see it fulfilled.
