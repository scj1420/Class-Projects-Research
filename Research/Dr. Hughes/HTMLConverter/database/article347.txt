   The fractal you can make with candy corn

   Making a Sierpinski triangle is one way to figure out how many
   candy corns are in a bag. Because I could make this level and
   not the next one, I know there were between 81 and 243 corns in
   the bag initially. A more accurate way to figure out the number
   of candies in the bag is to look at the nutrition label and do
   some basic arithmetic. Credit: Evelyn Lamb

   Every year around this time I think of the Sierpinski triangle.



   I dare you to watch that video and then eat some candy corn
   without singing “Candy corn colonels, candy corn colonels.”

   The Sierpinski triangle, like many fractals, can be built
   either “up” or “down.” To build it “down,” start with a solid
   triangle and then remove the middle quarter, remove the middle
   quarter of each remaining triangle, and so on. The object you
   have after infinitely many iterations is the Sierpinski
   triangle.

   To build it “up,” candy corn is recommended: make a little
   candy corn triangle, then make a triangle of triangles, then
   make a triangle of those larger triangles. It gets bigger and
   more complicated with each iteration. It doesn’t make much
   sense to say that the Sierpinski triangle is what you get when
   you repeat this process infinitely many times because that
   would just spill out everywhere, but you can imagine that at
   each stage you take a picture and squeeze it down so it takes
   up the same amount of space as it did before.

   In addition to those two straightforward ways of building the
   Sierpinski triangle, there are many other processes that all
   seem to magically converge on the Sierpinski triangle. You can
   play something called the “[35]chaos game” and watch random
   starting points transform into the Sierpinski triangle based on
   a few simple rules. You can [36]color in all the odd numbers in
   Pascal’s triangle, which was discovered by several different
   cultures, including Chinese and Indian, [37]centuries before
   Pascal was even born. You can draw a [38]single black square on
   a big grid and then proceed to follow the [39]cellular
   automaton called rule 90.


   But I want to think about another way to do it called
   Sierpinski’s arrowhead curve. To make this pretty shape, you
   start with a jagged line. At each step, you replace each
   straight line segment with another jagged line according to a
   couple of rules that you can see emerging in this illustration.

   I like the arrowhead curve because it shows that not only can
   you approach the Sierpinski triangle by whittling down
   two-dimensional shapes in the removing triangles version of the
   space, but you can also create it by building up a
   one-dimensional object. That makes some intuitive sense: the
   Sierpinski triangle is not quite one-dimensional and not quite
   two-dimensional. It’s really more like 1.585-dimensional. (For
   more on what a fractional dimension means, check out my post on
   another object with fractional dimension, the [43]Menger
   sponge.) If you can make the same object by thinning out
   something two-dimensional or fattening up something
   one-dimensional, it makes sense that in some sense its
   dimension lies between the two numbers.


   [44]Wacław Sierpiński’s name is on some pretty good
   mathematical objects. In addition to this fabulous triangle,
   there’s an analogous shape called the Sierpinski tetrahedron
   that lives in three-dimensional space. Then there’s the
   Sierpinski carpet, a two-dimensional version of the Menger
   sponge I wrote about a couple months ago. Finally, there's the
   space simply known as the Sierpinski space, which just has two
   points in it. Math grad student Tai-Danae Bradley recently
   wrote a [45]post about why those two measley points are
   interesting on her blog, Math3ma.


   Those other Sierpinski-honoring spaces are all perfectly
   respectable, but the triangle is the one that tastes the most
   like Halloween.
