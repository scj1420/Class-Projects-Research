Solution to last week‚Äôs Riddler Classic

   Congratulations to üëè Amy Leblang üëè of Wayland, Massachusetts,
   winner of [25]last week‚Äôs Classic puzzle!


   You have four ropes and a lighter. Each rope takes exactly an
   hour to burn from end to end, but they all burn at a
   nonconstant rate. You can light the ropes at their ends at any
   time you‚Äôd like. If you‚Äôre strategic in your pyromania, how
   many different specific lengths of time can you accurately
   measure?

   You can measure 23 different lengths. Here‚Äôs an explanation,
   adapted from the puzzle‚Äôs submitter, Peter Calhoun:

   The first trick is realizing that you can record 30 minutes by
   burning both ends of one rope. Since you know it takes an hour
   to burn through a rope from one end to the other, once the two
   burns meet you know each will have burned through 30 minutes of
   rope (even though they might not meet at the center of the rope
   thanks to the nonconstant burn rates). You also have to
   consider burning the ends of the ropes at different times. For
   example, to measure 45 minutes, you can burn both ends of the
   first rope and one end of the second rope. After 30 minutes
   have passed, you can burn the other end of the second rope,
   making 45 minutes.

   The calculation gets very tricky as we add ropes. Below are the
   possible lengths of time (in minutes, not including zero):

   One rope: 30 and 60

   Two ropes: 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120

   Three ropes: 30, 45, 52.5, 60, 67.5, 75, 90, 105, 120, 150 and
   180

   Four ropes: 30, 45, 52.5, 56.5, 60, 67.5, 71.25, 75, 78.75,
   82.5, 86.25, 90, 97.5, 105, 112.5, 120, 127.5, 135, 150, 165,
   180, 210 and 240

   Some of these time points are difficult to determine. For
   example, below are the many steps it takes to measure precisely
   71.25 minutes with four ropes. (Let \(r_i\) represent rope
   \(i\).)
    1. Light both ends of \(r_1\), one end of \(r_2\), and one end
       of \(r_3\)
    2. 30 minutes pass (\(r_1\) burned through)
    3. Light the other end of \(r_2\) and one end of \(r_4\)
    4. 15 minutes pass (\(r_2\) burned through)
    5. Light the other end of \(r_3\)
    6. 7.5 minutes pass (\(r_3\) burned through)
    7. Light the other end of \(r_4\)
    8. 18.75 minutes pass (\(r_4\) burned through)

   The total time passed is 71.25 minutes (=30+15+7.5+18.75).

   Solver Henry Maxfield plotted the times you can measure (in
   hours) using six, five, four, and so on down, different ropes:
   ropes

   And solver Thomas Conroy wrote a program in C++ to find the
   lengths of time, which he was kind enough to [26]post to
   GitHub.


   Finally, solver Russell Yu proposed the following general
   solution for the number of lengths of time, T, you can measure
   with N ropes:

   \begin{equation}T = 3 \cdot 2 ^ {N ‚Äì 1} ‚Äì 1\end{equation}
