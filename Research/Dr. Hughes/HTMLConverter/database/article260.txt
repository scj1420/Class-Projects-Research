   We’re in dire need of a word for the email you put off
   responding to because you want to give it your full
   attention—and thus never answer, giving the sender the
   impression you don’t care, when in fact it is the most
   important thing in your inbox.

   A concept that desperately needs a new word is when taking
   one’s own life includes violently taking the innocent lives of
   many others. Suicide by cop? Killing in order to be killed?
   Murder-suicide doesn’t capture this horror at all. Nor does the
   language of terror or degraded ideas of sacrifice and
   martyrdom. Will someone please find a new word for something
   with which we are growing all too familiar?

   The act of staring at electronics as though we had the
   superpower to speed up the function they are performing. I
   nominate Failikinesis.

   These days, I need a name for a social-media post I want to
   share but can’t because it’s been ruined by an obvious spelling
   or punctuation error.

   The Edwardians were preoccupied with the concept of progress,
   which they defined as measurable, scientific, and technical.
   But what about a word to describe progress in areas that defy
   any meaningful metric, such as love or elegance or amusement or
   mercy?

   Bryan A. Garner, author, Garner’s Modern English Usage

   We need a word for the mental suffering that results from
   someone else’s misuse of a word or phrase in one’s presence,
   the distress being magnified by an abiding sense of politeness
   that precludes correcting the other person—coupled with an
   intensifying melancholy about the confused changes that so many
   words are undergoing as a result of mass indifference to
   linguistic tradition. I suggest wordschmerz.

   The fallacy of attributing every unfortunate outcome to
   deliberate intent, and neglecting the possibility of
   incompetence, unplanned by-products, or entropy.

   As a noun, the Hawaiian word pono translates as “goodness,
   moral correctness, proper procedure, and welfare.” The
   adjective means “fitting, righteous, virtuous, or beneficial.”
   The adverb means “completely, exactly, and carefully,” and the
   verb (ho‘opono) means “to make right, to behave correctly.” I
   wish English had an equally supple word or phrase that didn’t
   contain the religious overtones of moral or righteous. Do the
   right thing comes close, but it’s a mouthful.
