[16]I am the get, or on role models/pressure


   [17]31 May


   Awhile back I did a post on various [18]podcast
   recommendations, and I pointed out a recent favorite of mine by
   an old classmate and her best friend, [19]the get.  Their
   [20]most recent episode really resonated with me and echoed
   some issues that I haven’t [21]talked about in years ([22]part
   2), so I thought I’d revisit them and talk about why I love
   this podcast so much.


   Two and a half years ago, I wrote this in an email to a
   professor, [23]referencing an earlier meeting:


     Upon reflection I believe that I felt like I was speaking on
     behalf of all women in a room full of men, a responsibility
     that I wasn’t prepared for.  It’s like having a discussion
     about race in a room with one person of color.  It’s a
     little weird.

   Part of Rhiana talks about in ep14 is the pressure she feels as
   a high-achieving minority, to continuously highly achieve on
   behalf of that minority group.  Whenever you’re in a group, be
   it a classroom, a meeting, or a collection of role models (you
   may not even know you’re in this group!), if you’re a
   super-minority then you represent that minority to people
   looking at that group.  Relevant comic:

   And that sort of pressure can be dangerous-I won’t tell you
   Rhiana’s story; you can listen for yourself and I’ll tell you
   my stories instead.  I’ve been incredibly lucky in my path to
   where I am now, with support since childhood with extra
   programs essentially designed to get me where I am today.
   Rhiana and Ivy had it even “worse” with a Rhodes and a Ford
   (fancy graduate fellowships).  What do I mean by “worse”?  I
   mean when you have all this support and have used up all of
   these resources to lead you to success, you feel even more
   pressure to succeed.  Success begets success.  Which is often a
   good thing, but the pressure can be crippling.  Related
   digression: [25]this movie (that I love and is directed by the
   Fast and the Furious director Justin Lin) is based on a
   [26]real life murder that happened at my rival high school,
   which was also an extremely high achieving high pressure
   environment.


   I’m planning on finishing my Ph.D. next year (spring 2017), so
   my thoughts have been leading to what’s coming next: do I
   [27]try to succeed in mathademia, or turn my back on all of
   these supporters and do something else?  Here are some mission
   statements of programs that have helped me:

       Foundation’s initiatives to increase diversity in the
       faculty ranks of institutions of higher learning.

       and[31]Pomona Colleges with the goal of strengthening the
       ability of women students to successfully complete PhD
       programs in the mathematical sciences and place more women
       in visible leadership roles in the mathematics community.

       students, [32]USTARS seeks to broaden the participation in
       the mathematical sciences


   So those mission statements imply that they gave me
   funding/programming/mentorship/networks because they want me to
   become a math professor.  Also, [33]having role models who
   [34]look like you is [35]extremely important for young people,
   especially underrepresented groups, to even begin to ideate
   what success could look like.  This belief, coupled with my
   experiences, makes me personally feel pressure to become a
   research mathematician and exist as an example and role model
   for others: look!  A woman mathematician!  They exist!  I
   recently saw this sweet video on upworthy and it’s from
   [36]this program that sends professionals to grade schools:


   IFRAME:
   s=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=t
   ransparent


   So being a role model is great!  But defining success for
   yourself is a key part of being successful, and going with
   something without examining it is not, in my
   opinion, [38]drinking life to the lees [which is a goal of my
   life].


   I spoke with [39]Evelyn Lamb, a friend and personal hero, about
   this tension between living up to expectations and figuring out
   your own path.  She pointed out, rightly, that she’s far, far
   more visible now as a math writer than she was as an assistant
   professor.  So if the goal is to show people that women can do
   math, she’s reaching the goal much more effectively by going
   her own way.  I’d be remiss not to mention [40]Erica Klarreich
   here and [41]promo my math field with her incredible article.


   To sum up: despite massive amounts of pressure from your own
   underrepresented group/your supporters/your funders/your
   family/anyone, you have to make your own decisions for your own
   success and happiness.  Maybe you’re incredibly motivated by
   the idea of being a role model for others, and that’s enough to
   launch you into whatever career.  I don’t personally feel that
   way, and I want my kids to see their mother loving her job and
   actively choosing it.  The goal of being a role model and
   showing people that women can do math is to encourage young
   women who might not realize they can become mathematicians that
   it’s a path available for them.  It’s not to pressure capable
   young women into some path that I’ve pre-determined as correct
   or better than whatever choices they’ll make.  Empowerment is
   not restricting choices, it’s expanding choices.

   Last bit: what do I mean when I say “I am the get”?  It’s from
   the first episode of Ivy and Rhiana’s podcast.  I can’t say it
   as well as Rhiana can, so here’s her words:

     One thing that always stuck out is that she told me that
     when I walk in there, like, I have to remember that I am the
     get. I am the thing that they need to have, I’m the thing
     that they want, and that I am…not a prize, but something to
     be gotten. I am an asset. […]we want our listeners to always
     remember that they are the get, that you are an asset, a
     thing to be gotten! You’re the thing that people want—and
     it’s so easy to forget that, especially if you’re a woman,
     especially if you’re a woman of color, especially if you’re
     a member of the number of marginalized groups in the US. So,
     we just wanted that to always be a reminder of self-love and
     of just how fucking awesome you are, all the time.

   I’m out!  Maybe baking next week; it’s been a while!
