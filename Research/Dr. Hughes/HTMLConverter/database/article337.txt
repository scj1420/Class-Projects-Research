Oscillators

   Jet lag is a common experience for airplane travelers crossing
   multiple time zones. Typical symptoms include drowsiness,
   discomfort, reduced functionality during the local daytime, and
   difficulty sleeping during the local nighttime. Simply
   explained, the human body follows a circadian rhythm that
   synchronizes with the local 24-hour day/night cycle of external
   natural conditions (particularly the rising and setting of the
   sun) and social conditions. Upon rapid crossing of several time
   zones, the body’s circadian oscillation needs time to
   resynchronize to the local oscillation phase of the external
   conditions; this resynchronization phase manifests as jet lag
   symptoms in travelers. Since resynchronization of an oscillator
   is a dynamical process, this phenomenon lends itself to
   mathematical modeling from a dynamical systems perspective.

   While the body produces many signals that help determine its
   circadian rhythm, one bodily region seems particularly
   important in this process: the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a
   tiny region of the brain’s hypothalamus. Physiological studies
   show that the SCN contains of the order of \(10^4\) neural
   oscillators, and that it is reasonable to assume that, in
   isolation, the periods of individual oscillators are
   distributed with a small dispersion around a mean slightly
   longer than 24 hours. When coupled together within the SCN,
   these oscillators are thought to undergo collective
   synchronization with each other as well as with external
   stimuli experienced by the individual, e.g., the rising and
   setting of the sun. This information provides the basis for our
   model’s construction, as well as others that have preceded it.
   The modeling that we employ [4], however, is different from
   previous attempts in that we start at the microscopic level of
   the individual coupled SCN oscillators, but then reduce the
   high-dimensional microscopic description to a low-dimensional
   macroscopic description. Our model’s primary purpose is to
   address the empirical observation that jet lag is more severe
   (i.e., requires a longer recovery time) for eastward travel
   than for westward travel across the same number of time zones.
   Specifically, we explore to what extent this east/west jet lag
   asymmetry may be explained by the small amount by which the
   average SCN period exceeds 24 hours.

   Since we wish to understand the interplay between global travel
   and resynchronization in a large collection of \(N\) neuronal
   oscillators, we use a very simplified model for the neuronal
   oscillators, perhaps at some expense of realism. As in the
   well-known Kuramoto model [1], the complicated dynamics of each
   oscillator are reduced to a time evolution equation for a phase
   \(\theta_i(t)\), representing the state of the \(i^{th}\)
   oscillator where \(i=1,2,...,N.\) The phases of the oscillators
   advance in time, according to the model


   \[ \frac{d\theta_i}{dt} = \omega_i + \frac{K}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}
   sin (\theta_j - \theta_i) + F sin(\sigma t - \theta_i + p).
   \tag1 \]

   Here, \(\omega_i\) is the natural frequency for each oscillator
   which, in our model, is drawn from a distribution
   \(g(\omega_i)\) that peaks at a value of
   \(\omega\), corresponding to a period just over 24 hours. The
   second term on the right describes the cells’ tendency to
   synchronize with each other, and has coupling strength \(K\).
   The third term represents interaction with the outside world,
   particularly the effect of sunlight. It attracts, with strength
   \(F\), each cell to a phase \(\sigma t + p\), where \(\sigma =
   2 \pi/24\: \textrm{hrs}^{-1}\) is the daily frequency and \(p\)
   is a phase that depends on time zone. If \(t\) is Greenwich
   Mean Time, positive \(p\),  \(0 < p < \pi\), corresponds to
   east of Greenwich and negative \(p\),  \(0 > p > -\pi\), to
   west of Greenwich.

   As simple as this model is, it still requires solving a large
   number, \(N \sim 10^4\), of coupled equations. We address this
   requirement with two further simplifications. First, we pass to
   the continuum limit, \(N \to \infty\), where the state of the
   SCN is characterized by a time-dependent distribution of
   oscillator phases and frequencies, \(f(\theta, \omega, t)\).
   This \(N \to \infty\) limit should be a good approximation for
   \(N \gg 1\). Second, we use the so-called Ott-Antonsen ansatz
   [5], which represents an exact solution for the distribution
   \(f\). This ansatz postulates a particular form for \(f(\theta,
   \omega, t)\), which yields a reduced system when substituted
   into the continuum system. Furthermore, [6] shows that under
   weak conditions and at large time, \(f\) converges in
   probability to the solution of the reduced description. Thus,
   we capture all attractors and bifurcations. In the case of a
   Lorenzian distribution of natural oscillator frequencies,
   \(g(\omega) = (\triangle / \pi)\lbrack(\omega - \omega_0)^2 +
   \triangle^2\rbrack^{-1}\), the macroscopic state of the SCN is
   described by a single complex variable \(z=N^{-1}\sum_{j}exp
   \lbrack i(\theta_j - \sigma t - p)\rbrack\), which evolves
   according to the equation


   \[\frac{dz(t)}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} \lbrack (Kz + F) - (Kz + F)^*
   z^2\rbrack - \big(\triangle + i(\omega_0 - \sigma)\big) z,
   \tag2 \] where the polar angle of the complex variable \(z\)
   represents the collective global oscillation phase of the SCN.
   Thus, the ansatz reduces an \(N\)-dimensional system to this
   single, first-order, complex ordinary differential equation,
   enabling rapid scanning in parameter space and enhanced
   understanding of the dynamics.

   Although the ansatz owes its discovery to an investigation [2]
   into the macroscopic behavior of solutions of \((1)\), it turns
   out that this dimension reduction result applies, not only to
   \((1)\) [3] but to a very large class of interesting
   situations. These include, for example, a model of
   pedestrian-induced wobbling of London’s Millennium
   Bridge, Josephson junction circuits, a model of birdsong, and
   networks of pulse-coupled neurons. One can also generalize it
   to include additional dynamical features, like time delays in
   the effect of one oscillator upon another, the effects of
   different types of network topology, spatial coupling, and
   feedback control.

   The model \((2)\) has three parameter regimes with
   qualitatively different dynamics, as depicted in Figure 1. We
   expect a healthy person’s circadian rhythm to entrain with the
   external 24-hour period, which corresponds to a stable fixed
   point in the \(z\)-phase-space (the black dot in Figure 1a and
   1b). An individual whose circadian rhythm is not synched with
   the external 24-hour period corresponds to a
   \(z\)-phase-portrait, as shown in Figure 1c, where the
   individual’s circadian phase relative to the phase of the
   external drive continually drifts around a closed curve, a
   periodic orbit in \(z\). There is a difference between dynamics
   corresponding to Figure 1a and 1b; through a saddle-node
   bifurcation, Figure 1b has—besides the stable fixed point—two
   other fixed points, one unstable (shown as an open circle) and
   one a saddle (shown as a cross). The unstable manifold of the
   saddle forms a loop, along which \(z\) can approach the stable
   fixed point (black dot) from two opposite directions.

   To analyze recovery of a healthy individual from jet lag, we
   assume that the traveler is entrained to his/her pre-travel
   time zone (\(z\) at the stable fixed point) before the trip.
   For simplicity, we also assume that the traveler’s
   cross-time-zone travel is very fast, and model it as a
   discontinuous change of \(p\) in \((1)\). Thus, immediately
   after travel, the state variable \(z\) is suddenly displaced by
   a rotation \((|z| \textrm{fixed})\) by the angle \(\lbrack
   p(initial) - p(final)\rbrack\). Depending on where the trip
   ends, \(z\) moves back to the stable fixed point either by
   advancing or delaying its phase. We are particularly interested
   in the east-west asymmetry in the direction of recovery and the
   time it takes for the recovery to occur. We use a ‘typical’ set
   of parameters representative of a typical healthy individual.
   This set of parameters yields the dynamics shown in Figure 1a,
   where only one fixed point is stable. The mean oscillation
   period of SCN cells when external drive is absent is taken to
   be 24.5 hours, consistent with experimental observations. This
   computation surprisingly indicates that the small amount (~30
   minutes) by which the natural SCN period exceeds 24 hours in a
   typical human is sufficient to explain the rather noticeable
   east-west asymmetry of jet lag.

   Edward Ott will present the Jürgen Moser Lecture, “Emergent
   Behavior in Large Systems of Many Coupled Oscillators,” at the
   SIAM Conference on Applications of Dynamical Systems (DS17), to
   be held in Snowbird, UT, this May. He will also organize and
   give a talk at a minisymposium on “Using reservoir computers to
   learn dynamical systems,” while Michelle Girvan will speak at a
   minisymposium titled “Symmetry, Asymmetry, and Network
   Synchronization.”
