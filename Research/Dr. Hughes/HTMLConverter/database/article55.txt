   One of the mainstays of differential geometry is the theory of
   differential forms on a smooth manifold, i.e., the players in
   what is generally called the de Rham complex for the manifold.
   The habitat for these differential forms is the graded vector
   space of \(k\)-fold wedge products of differentials, with
   coefficients being smooth functions on the manifold; the
   differentials themselves are the natural generators of the
   manifold’s cotangent spaces (working locally, i.e. in terms of
   local coordinates), and we vary \(k\) from \(0\) to the
   dimension of the manifold. Thus, still working locally, the
   differentials on the manifold constitute the dual basis to the
   natural basis for the tangent spaces. One then obtains the de
   Rham complex by virtue of the differential operator \(d\)
   taking \(k\)-forms to \((k+1)\)-forms, and one gets that
   \(d^2=0\) as an immediate consequence of a straightforward
   calculation in the context of exterior algebra, i.e. the yoga
   of the wedge product. So we get, right off, two titanic themes,
   namely, the cohomology of the manifold, aka de Rham cohomology,
   entirely as a consequence of having a differential complex as
   just indicated, and the general version of Stokes’ Theorem,
   which one can think of as the most evolved form of the
   Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and Green’s Theorem: it’s all
   ultimately quite the same.

   In this setting we also encounter the Theorem of de Rham
   properly so-called, asserting essentially that different
   flavors of cohomology are the same. In the book under review
   these important results occur thrice: on p. 70 Vaisman shows
   that the de Rham cohomology groups can be realized via
   presheaves, on p. 82 he shows that for paracompact spaces the
   de Rham cohomology groups can be realized in terms of sheaves,
   and on p. 203 he derives the indicated theorem for real
   cohomology from that for sheaves. What is at issue here is, of
   course, that cohomology is taken with varying coefficients,
   from presheaves on the underlying space, to sheaves, and then
   to the real numbers, realized (in case the underlying space is
   a manifold) as a constant sheaf.

   So in a very noteworthy sense the story is told backwards, as
   it were, given that presheaves and sheaves are more
   sophisticated entities that the real numbers and the latter
   situation, i.e. de Rham cohomology, with real coefficients, for
   a smooth manifold, is manifestly what is of most use and
   interest to, say, differential geometers — or so one would
   imagine. But Vaisman’s approach makes it clear that the largely
   French revolution of the 1950s, led by H. Cartan, Serre, and
   Grothendieck, has indeed resulted in more liberty: by going at
   things with category theory, presheaves and sheaves, and so on,
   a very general framework is created from the outset in which
   major results like de Rham’s theorem, can be presented most
   effectively and holistically. Bourbaki vindicatus.

   Vaisman’s book is accordingly a testament to what is a most
   fecund way of doing geometry, be it algebraic or differential,
   although clearly the general methodology of sheaf theory is
   most closely associated with the former. But this is not to
   minimize the role played by the indicated methods in
   differential geometry, as Vaisman’s treatment amply
   illustrates. It is interesting to note, for example, how
   heavily certain developments in its pages involve Chern’s
   results: differential geometry par excellence.

   Yes, this is an excellent book, and will serve, even now, over
   forty-three years after its first appearance (kudos to Dover,
   as always, for reissuing the book), as an excellent
   introduction to not just sheaf cohomology (and ipso facto the
   category theory everyone needs to know) but also to
   differential geometry proper, the theory of fiber and vector
   bundles and characteristic classes (well, let’s just say Chern
   classes), and even certain themes in Riemannian geometry.
