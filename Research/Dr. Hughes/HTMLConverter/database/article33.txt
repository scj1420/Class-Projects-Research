   To go to space we need math. Lots of it.

   Most of us look in awe at the towering rocket ship strapped to
   the launching platform and forget the tremendous amount of work
   it took for it to get there — and, from there, to get into
   Earth's orbit and beyond. Engineering, math, physics,
   chemistry, computer science: It's all there, waiting for
   blast-off.

   Now, travel back to 1961, when the U.S.A. was behind the Soviet
   Union in the space race. It all started with Sputnik, a 184-lb.
   silver ball, 23 inches in diameter, [235]launched into orbit by
   the Soviets on Oct. 4, 1957. Less than a month later, the
   Soviets launched Sputnik 2, with the dog Laika as passenger.
   Getting to the moon and putting humans into orbit was the next
   logical step.


   A sequence of space flights from the U.S. and the Soviet Union
   followed. This was no friendly competition. At the height of
   the Cold War, space was seen as the new frontier, the place to
   dominate — or be dominated. The stakes got higher when the
   cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first man to orbit the Earth
   on April 12, 1961.

   This is where the hit movie [236]Hidden Figures begins, in the
   heat of the race. NASA had been founded only three years
   earlier. The pressure, both political and public, to succeed
   was enormous. National pride was in the balance. Plus, in the
   midst of Cold War paranoia, who knew what the Soviets were
   planning to do "up there?"


   The movie paints an accurate picture of the political
   expectations of the time, the widespread fear. But its beating
   heart is the science done by three African-American ladies, all
   brilliant at what they did. Aspiring engineer Mary Jackson
   (Janelle Monáe) accidentally spots a fault in the heat-shield
   tiles of an experimental capsule. In the movie version, NASA
   was segregated in 1961. To go to the bathroom, human "computer"
   Katherine Goble (played beautifully by Taraji Henson), had to
   scamper half a mile across the Langley Research Center
   facility. The amazing mathematician, the first "colored" woman
   in the team, couldn't even drink coffee from the same coffee
   maker as her peers. These people computed launching and
   re-entry trajectories by hand! And Goble was an absolute marvel
   at this, to the surprise, and even disgust, of her envious
   white-male colleagues.

   Hidden Figures was deservedly nominated for best picture. Nice
   to see long mathematical equations flowing on a tall blackboard
   in a movie that has been so successful in the box office. I
   confess my embarrassment, while watching the movie, for not
   knowing any of this story. I mean, this is a true story every
   little boy and girl, especially girl, should know. How could I
   have missed this?

   The third in the group, Dorothy Vaughan, played movingly by
   Octavia Spencer, fought in vain to be promoted to supervisor, a
   job she was already doing in practice. Her break finally came
   when NASA bought an IBM 7090 electronic computer that no one,
   apparently, knew how to program. Dorothy, with a knack for
   mechanical contraptions (yes, computers at the time had many
   moving parts, levers, tapes, and connecting wires and plugs),
   learns how to set it up. A visionary, she borrows a book about
   FORTRAN at the public library, the programming language people
   still use today for launching rockets. (With some modifications
   of course.) She gains everyone's respect and gets her promotion
   as supervisor of the programming department, bringing her other
   "colored" girls with her.

   The movie builds up its narrative from connecting the three
   stories, playing with historical accuracy to get its message
   across. In reality, NASA wasn't segregated when it substituted
   NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) in 1958.
   Dorothy Vaughan was promoted to supervisor in computing in
   1949. Mary Jackson completed her engineering degree in 1958,
   becoming NASA's first black female engineer. Katherine Johnson
   had been in the Flight Research Division since 1953 and moved
   into the Space Task Group when it was formed in 1958. Her boss,
   played in the movie by Kevin Costner, was not Al Harrison but
   Robert Gilruth. John Glenn did ask her to check on the IBM
   re-entry calculations.

   So, the amazing thing here is that the true history of these
   three women is even more remarkable and trailblazing than the
   one portrayed in the movie.

   What the movie does, and does beautifully, is weave their
   professional and personal lives together, humanizing them,
   showing how science and deep emotions and feelings are
   perfectly compatible, something many tend to dismiss. The movie
   is a celebration of the human spirit, of the power of
   individual determination and drive, and of the need for a
   nation to stand together, to look beyond racial and cultural
   differences in order to face a new challenge. There is much
   ugliness portrayed in the segregated Virginia of the early
   1960s, a somber echo of a past that is still so present and, in
   a new incarnation, that threatens to destabilize this nation
   once again. If there is a central lesson in the movie, it is
   that united we win; that what makes America great is not
   segregation and intolerance, but openness and inclusiveness.
