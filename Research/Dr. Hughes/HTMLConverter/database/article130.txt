   Andrew Wiles is a mathematical legend. In 1993, after years of
   working in secret, he [17]announced a proof of Fermat's last
   theorem, which had been taunting mathematicians for centuries.


   In these two short videos, filmed at the [18]Heidelberg
   Laureate Forum, Wiles talks about what it's like to do
   mathematics and how it's all about being creative, why he
   worked in secret and what it feels like solving a famous
   problem like Fermat's: "It's what we live for!"
