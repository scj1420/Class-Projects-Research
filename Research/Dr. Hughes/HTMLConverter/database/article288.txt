Solution to last week’s Riddler Express

   Congratulations to 👏 Fritz Burkhardt 👏 of South Burlington,
   Vermont, winner of [23]last week’s Express puzzle!


   A rope is tied tightly around the circumference of the Earth.
   It’s then lengthened by 1 meter and raised up at every point
   from the ground until it is again a taut circle and every point
   on the rope is the same height above the ground. How high is
   the rope off the ground? About 16 centimeters.

   One lousy meter is nothing compared with the circumference of
   the Earth, for goodness sakes, so the intuitive answer would
   seem to be “not very high at all” or even “so small as to be
   barely noticeable.” But intuition fails us in this case.

   What is the circumference of the Earth in meters? It doesn’t
   matter! You needn’t know to solve this problem. For now, let’s
   just call the circumference \(C\) and the Earth’s radius \(R\).
   (These will drop out of our equations after a bit of algebra.)
   Let little \(r\) be the added radius from the lengthened string
   — precisely the value we’re looking for to solve the problem.
   One last common geometry fact we’ll need: A circle’s
   circumference is two times \(\pi\) times its radius. (Happy
   belated [24]Pi Day, by the way.)


   After some simple rearranging, we can solve for r, which in
   this case represents the height of the rope off the Earth’s
   surface:

   \begin{align}
   C + 1 &= 2π(R + r)\tag{1}\\
   2πR + 1 &= 2πR + 2πr\tag{2}\\
   1 &= 2πr\tag{3}\\
   r &= \frac{1}{2π}\tag{4}\\
   \end{align}

   To run you through all that math, Step 1’s left-hand side
   represents the new rope’s length, in terms of circumference,
   and equates that to the new rope’s length in terms of radii. In
   Step 2, we substitute in the formula for circumference on the
   left and multiply through the parentheses on the right. In Step
   3, we subtract \(2\pi R\) from both sides. And in Step 4, we
   divide both sides by \(2\pi\) and put our variable of interest
   on the left-hand side.

   So the added height of the rope above the Earth is \(1 /
   (2\pi)\) meters, or about 16 centimeters, or just over 6
   inches. That measly meter added to the entire circumference of
   the Earth bought us enough height for a cat to slip under.
