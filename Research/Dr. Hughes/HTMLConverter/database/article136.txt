       Thanks so much for this contact with people that have been
       only names in articles to me. Somehow your having contact
       with them brought them closer to me. How fortunate for you
       to get to be in the same room with them! This was a fun
       change for your drawingd.

       I don’t comprehend the Langlands Program, but am fascinated
       that it is working to bring unification to broad, disparate
       fields of mathematics… and then perhaps be applied to
       fundamental physics as well. Was it discussed or updated at
       the conference?

       Do you have any resources surrounding the connections
       between non-abelian number theory and physics? I don’t know
       much about physics, but I love number theory and am very
       interested in knowing non-mathematics uses of it.

            Work of Ken Ono, for instance, on mock modular forms
            has apparently been applied to black hole physics eg
            pdf

                 thanks! Looks like some dense reading (see what I
                 did there? ^.^ ).

       I can not see how number theory can survive on its own
       apart from theoretical physics. Ultimately the numbers have
       to apply to *something* to have any value (no pun
       intended). In physics all theories can be tested,
       eventually. In mathematics you gotta wait for somebody else
       to do your proving for you. Sorry, small fish.

            Application is secondary… pure mathematics has no
            issue standing on its own.

            Number theory has had no problem surviving, and being
            one of the most prolific branches of math, for several
            millenia, even though it had practically no
            applications until the 20th century. Why would the
            future be any different? As long as there are
            interesting problems to research, there’s no reason it
            should lose momentum. Most math isn’t motivated by
            applications outside of it.
            And even if you needed applications, its applications
            to cryptography would be enough to keep it afloat
            anyway.
