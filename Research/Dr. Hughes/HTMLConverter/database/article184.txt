   I hope you enjoyed the first week of puzzles. Instead of just
   sending you running for your calculator, I really hope they
   made you think. [12]You can find the solutions to the Week 1
   puzzles here, but as with most things, answers usually only
   bring more questions. The best part of this process is, in my
   opinion, the solutions — the discussion and the analysis.


   This week I’ve got three new problems for you. Last week we
   were playing around with my favorite number. This week, well …
   hopefully you can figure out the common theme!

   1) What is the smallest amount of money (in U.S. currency) that
   cannot be represented using six coins (quarters, dimes, nickels
   and pennies) or fewer?

   2) Seven ants are placed on the top of a stick that’s one foot
   long. Each ant travels either left or right along the stick at
   a speed of four feet per minute. If two ants collide, they both
   reverse direction. If an ant reaches the end of the stick, it
   falls off. What’s the shortest amount of time you would have to
   wait to guarantee that there are no more ants on the stick?

   3) A man flips two coins. One of the coins landed on heads.
   What’s the probability that the other is also heads?
