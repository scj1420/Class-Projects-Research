NPZ Model: Maturity in the Juvenile Zooplankton

   Planktonic ecosystems make up the bottom nutritive levels of
   aquatic food webs, providing a vital source of food to many
   large marine organisms. Researchers build
   nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) mathematical models in
   order to describe the bottom trophic levels of aquatic
   ecosystems, aiding future research of phytoplankton.

   In a paper recently published in the [48]SIAM Journal on
   Applied Mathematics, authors Sue Ann Campbell, Matt Kloosterman
   and Francis J. Poulin conducted a study of a closed NPZ model
   to understand the role of maturity in the juvenile zooplankton
   population within an ecosystem.


   Using different forms of the NPZ model, the authors performed a
   qualitative analysis of the solutions, studying existence and
   uniqueness, positivity and boundedness, local and global
   stability of the solutions as well as conditions for
   extinction. The authors show that an NPZ model can provide a
   more accurate description of reality and still be able to
   obtain results analytically. The authors were also able to add
   size dependence and spatial dependence to the NPZ model. This
   leads to rich modeling possibilities, such as coupling with
   external factors like fluid dynamics or higher predation.

   In this study, the authors were able to choose the modeling
   framework that is most convenient for the situation at hand.
   Furthermore, in a practical sense, the different models offer
   flexibility in what initial data is required for numerical
   simulations.
