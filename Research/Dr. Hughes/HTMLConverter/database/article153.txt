   Wow, A+ prime there! At first glance I thought it had to be
   divisible by 11. Good thing I'm not the prime number tweetbot.

            I wonder what proportion of numbers w/ digits
            2,2,5,5,9,9 are divisible by 11. Is it 50%?

            So instead of counting I'm just coming up with
            heuristics. 1st heuristic was 50% but I'm revising
            that to 12.5%.

            Well that was fun! I stand by my initial reaction that
            the number looked like it was divisible by 11.

            Since on average only 9% of numbers are, and 40% of
            these kinds of numbers are.

            (I'm conveniently ignoring the fact that I saw the
            number from a bot that tweets only numbers that are
            not divisible by 11.)

            (Except for 11 itself, but that was a long time ago.
            Get over it.)
