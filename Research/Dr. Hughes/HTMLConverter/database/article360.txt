   Honoring top math and science teachers

   Recipients of Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics
   and Science Teaching honored in Washington

   This year, the White House honored [95]213 recipients of the
   Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science
   Teaching (PAEMST). In September, those awardees traveled to
   Washington, D.C., where leaders in science, technology,
   education and mathematics (STEM) congratulated them in person.


   "By virtue of receiving a PAEMST award, each of you is
   recognized as a model for your colleagues, an inspiration to
   your students and communities, and a leader in the advancement
   of math and science education," France Córdova, director of the
   National Science Foundation (NSF), told the assembled
   recipients.

   The awards are the highest honor bestowed by the government on
   K-12 mathematics and science teachers. NSF receives
   recommendations from states and territories of some of their
   best and most inspiring teachers, then reviews the submissions
   and forwards recommendations to the White House Office of
   Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).

   "I'm sure you all know how important your job is, how enormous
   a difference a good teacher makes, how you are changing lives
   one student at a time," OSTP Director John P. Holdren,
   assistant to the president for science and technology, told the
   group. "I think virtually every successful scientist, engineer
   and mathematician I know can remember a particular teacher who
   made a difference in his or her life. I know I do."

   Awardees told NSF that they focus on creating classroom
   experiences that go beyond memorization of scientific facts and
   equations, helping students build affinities for science,
   technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).

   PAEMST recipients must show that they developed and implemented
   high-quality instructional programs that enhance student
   learning, demonstrating what Joan Ferrini-Mundy, head of NSF's
   Education and Human Resources Directorate, called "an elaborate
   set of accomplishments."

   "Our group of awardees demonstrates excellence in these areas,"
   she said.

   This year's awardees include 108 kindergarten- to 6th-grade
   teachers and 105 seventh- through 12th-grade teachers. Each
   received $10,000 from NSF and an expense-paid trip to
   Washington, D.C. President Obama [96]announced their names
   earlier this year, and OSTP posted a [97]blog about their
   experiences during their trip. Highlights from this year's
   events include:

       awardees heard from keynote speaker New York Hall of
       Science President and CEO, Margaret Honey. Secretary of
       Education John B. King Jr. also commended the awardees via
       recorded video.
       congratulated the awardees on their successes in the
       classroom and beyond, and emphasized the important role
       they play in ensuring a robust economy and sustainable
       future for today's youth. He was joined by U.S. Chief
       Technology Officer Megan Smith, who shared in recognizing
       the awardees.
       Education, where awardees explored the research behind
       student and teacher engagement as co-learners. The
       symposium included a focus on innovations in mathematics
       learning, an area which requires special consideration to
       improve STEM learning outcomes at all ages. PAEMST awardees
       heard from national experts on active learning, as well as
       OSTP Associate Director for Science Jo Handelsman.

       Constitution Hall, where NSF's Córdova and Ferrini-Mundy
       and OSTP's Holdren addressed the teachers. More than 700
       guests were present, including Reps. Madeleine Bordallo of
       Guam, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, Jerry McNerney of
       California and Paul Tonko of New York.
       which NSF and OSTP convened leaders in K-12 education to
       discuss and share knowledge about key components for
       effective STEM high schools of the 21st century. Featured
       speakers included OSTP Deputy Director for Policy Tom
       Kalil, George Washington University professor Sharon Lynch
       and SRI International Center for Technology in Learning
       Director Barbara Means.

       of Elementary Presidential Awardees President Kathy
       Horstmeyer, Association of Presidential Awardees in Science
       Teaching President Linda Smith and Council of Presidential
       Awardees in Mathematics President David Masunaga.

   The Symposium on Active Learning in STEM Education and Next
   Generation STEM High School Forum were organized by NSF and the
   Center for Innovative Research on Cyberlearning at SRI
   International.

   NSF has hosted the PAEMST program on behalf of OSTP since 1983.
   Applications for the next round of seventh through 12th grade
   teachers open in the fall of 2016. Nominations are accepted at
   the [100]PAEMST website.
