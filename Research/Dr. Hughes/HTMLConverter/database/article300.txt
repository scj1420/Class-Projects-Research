Problem

   There is a lightbulb inside a closet. The door is closed, and
   you cannot see if the light is on or off through the door.
   However, you know the light is off to start. Outside of the
   closet, there are three light switches. One of the switches
   controls the lightbulb in the closet. You can flip the switches
   however you want, but once you open the door, you can no longer
   touch the switches.

   light?
