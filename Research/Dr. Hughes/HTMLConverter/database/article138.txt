   Today’s assignment: The content. What should students be
   expected to know by the time they leave school?

   Southeast Asia Resource Action Center

   Students will leave school with the ability to think critically
   and independently, to leverage and adapt to ever-shifting
   technology and modes of communication, to navigate and direct
   their own independent research, and to understand how to
   collaborate with others. There also will be a stronger focus on
   both career preparation and college readiness. That means
   integrating the soft skills that current employers find
   valuable, as well as technology readiness. All of this will be
   taught in the context of the subjects we associate with
   school—art, history, science, and math—but we have to think
   more creatively about how we present concepts, content, and
   opportunities to really expand students’ ways of thinking. Math
   doesn’t always have to be taught in a 40- to 50-minute
   dedicated chunk of time. It can be—if that’s appropriate for
   the age and learning objectives, especially for advanced math
   and science—but we need to reorganize and disrupt how we are
   currently teaching students.

   a Thousand Kids

   Debating the design of core curricula is a way for grownups to
   entertain themselves, but it doesn't help children get anywhere
   worth going. We should demand that all reformers and armchair
   rigorists do some actual public-school teaching—maybe three
   weeks as a substitute every year—as a precondition to
   furthering their proposed changes.

   Most learning, beginning with speech—which is the real
   miracle—happens outside of school.

   But reading in school is crucial, obviously. More silent
   reading and reading to friends—reading of anything—is a good
   idea. Kids know how to talk—they're remarkably enterprising
   talkers, in fact—but many stumble over the decoding of simple
   sentences, even in high school. Some days, if they hate
   eye-reading, let them listen to audiobooks and
   podcasts—whatever holds their interest, and delights them, and
   makes them laugh. Have them write in one- or two-paragraph
   bursts after they've done some reading. Don't require outlines.
   Toss the standard essay form out the window. Avoid horrible
   two-week-long projects.

   Hire teachers who are good explainers, who are curious about
   the world's infinite subject matter. Pay them more and give
   them their heads. Let them lead their classes in surprising
   directions.

   Education

   Anyone who claims they know what students will need to know and
   be able to do 20 years from now is engaging in speculation.
   Technology is moving at an astounding rate, and the job market
   of the next generation is impossible to predict. We do students
   a disservice when we follow fads—students will learn
   technological skills on their own. What remains invaluable is a
   sound academic education that develops well-rounded, informed
   citizens of the nation and the world.

   Our society needs adults who are competent, critical readers
   who can write with clarity and purpose. Fluency in math is
   important not only for the development of computational skills,
   but also because of the abstract reasoning it develops. As
   important as literacy and numeracy are, students deserve so
   much more. They need knowledge of historical events along with
   the ability to analyze those events from differing points of
   view. Students deserve to communicate in a second language. A
   physical or biological science along with hands-on laboratory
   experiences will be a part of school curriculum every year. And
   all students will participate in the arts at least through
   their elementary- and middle-school years.

   I am a great fan of the International Baccalaureate program,
   which integrates all of the above and more. Its curriculum and
   assessments should be a model for all schools.

   Content will address cognitive development but also social,
   emotional, and physical needs. How this is addressed is
   age-related. Students need content to equip them for their
   future lives as adults—traditional subjects, but also courses
   in psychology, economics, life skills, drugs/medicine, health,
   and philosophy/world religions. Students will leave school with
   knowledge of themselves, their strengths, their abilities, and
   their areas needing growth. Subjects will vary for the
   different grade levels, but at each level, there will be an
   integration of real-world application—science will involve
   project-based learning and service learning, such as making a
   useful product. Teachers will play a major role in helping to
   organize the day. They know students best. Traditional subjects
   will have to be taught within context and with unconventional
   methods, such as the use of music, songwriting, raps, visual
   art, and trips outside of the classroom that will enrich the
   learning experience.
