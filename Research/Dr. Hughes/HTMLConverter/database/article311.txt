   This is the title page of An Elementary Treatise on Plane and
   Spherical Trigonometry, and on the Application of Algebra to
   Geometry; from the Mathematics of Lacroix and Bèzout, second
   edition, 1826. The first edition was published in 1820. It is
   believed to have been translated from French to English by
   [312]John Farrar (1779-1853) [1], who was Hollis Professor of
   Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Harvard College in
   Cambridge, Massachusetts, from 1807 to 1836 [2].


   [313]Étienne  Bézout (1730–1783) was a noted French algebraist.
   He wrote a six-volume comprehensive work titled Cours complet
   de mathématiques à l'usage de la marine et de l'artillerie
   (1770–1782), which was considered accessible to students who
   wished to enter the École Polytechnique. Bézout’s texts were
   translated into English and used in both England and America,
   including at Harvard [3]. As seen in the preceding webpages,
   Lacroix wrote a similar “course” of elementary texts,
   considered to be accessible to students of mathematics at a
   slightly higher level than those of Bézout [4]. In the
   "Advertisement" below, the translator explained exactly which
   parts of Lacroix's and Bézout's series of texts he used to form
   the volume featured on this page.


   The “Advertisement,” above, serves as a preface and indicates
   specifically the reliance of the American textbook writer on
   his French sources.

   The “Table of Contents,” above, indicates the topics of study
   at this time.
