A Bike Wheel and the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem

   By [47]Mark Levi


   While fixing a punctured bike tire one day, I asked myself
   whether a wheel, held by the axle and having zero spin, can
   still turn around the axis. To be specific, let us make the
   axle describe a closed cone \(C\), coming back to its original
   position and keeping the center of the wheel fixed (the cone
   need not be circular). Despite the fact that the wheel never
   spins (the bearings are perfect) it ends up rotated, and
   through the angle that turns out (apologies for the pun) to
   equal the solid angle \(A(C)\) of the cone \(C\).

   A geometric theorem about cones can explain this effect. As the
   wheel’s axis traces the cone \(C\) in Figures 1 and 2, the
   plane of the wheel remains tangential to another cone
   \(C^\ast\), the envelope of the family of planes normal to the
   generators of \(C\). In fact, the plane of the wheel rolls on
   \(C^\ast\) without sliding, as explained in Figure 2 (this kind
   of rolling is in complete contrast to the conventional way a
   wheel rolls on the ground). One can think of the two cones as a
   bouquet of right angle brackets, as in Figure 1. Speaking
   loosely, if one cone is sharp, the other is obtuse. The exact
   relationship between the cones turns out to be the following:

   \[A(C)+L( C^\ast) = 2 \pi,\tag{1}\]

   where \(L(C^\ast)\) denotes the length of the curve of
   intersection of the cone \(C^\ast\) with the unit sphere. A
   physical “proof” of this theorem, along with a rigorous proof,
   can be found in [1]. The physical “proof”—which led me to
   discover \((1)\) in the first place—uses imaginary springs and
   vacuum.


   Figure 1. The dual cone C* is the envelope of the family of
   normal planes to the generators of C.

   According to \((1)\), \(A(C)= 2 \pi - L(C^\ast)\); Figure 2
   shows that the last expression is precisely the turning angle
   of the wheel, as claimed.

   In fact, the “dual cones” theorem of \((1)\) implies a more
   general fact, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem – a generalization of
   the fact that the curvature \(k\) of a smooth, closed
   non-self-intersecting planar curve \(\gamma\) satisfies
   \(\int_{ \gamma} k\;ds= 2 \pi.\) According to this theorem (not
   stated here in its full generality), for a patch \(S\) of a
   smooth surface with a smooth boundary \(\gamma\) (see Figure
   3), one has

   \[ \int_{S} K\,dS+\int_{\gamma}k\,ds  = 2 \pi, \tag{2}\]

   where \(K\) is the Gaussian curvature and \(k\) is the geodesic
   curvature of \(\gamma\). According to \((2)\), the bulging of
   \(S\) decreases the total geodesic curvature of the boundary,
   speaking loosely (only the case \(K>0\) is discussed here).

   Figure 2. The plane of the wheel rolls on C* without sliding.
   Indeed, the wheel is (i) tangential to C* and (ii) the tangency
   spoke is aligned with the instantaneous angular velocity
   vector. Hence that spoke is instantaneously at rest, meaning
   zero sliding. One can think of the disk picking up wet paint
   from the cone; the angle of the dirty sector on the wheel is
   L(C), same as the angle of the flattened cone.

   The Gauss-Bonnet theorem boils down to the dual cones theorem
   \((1)\), as outlined in Figure 3. Starting with the surface
   patch \(S\), we construct the “porcupine” cone \(C\) of unit
   normal vectors \(n\) (the Gauss cone – Figure 3, right) and
   consider its dual cone \(C^*\). Intuitively, we can think of
   walking along \(\gamma\) and carrying a non-spinning wheel,
   keeping its axis (unit vector \(n\)) normal to \(S\). The
   wheel’s instantaneous angular velocity points along one of the
   spokes \(n^*\) (since the wheel is not spinning on its axis);
   these vectors transported to a common starting point form the
   dual cone \(C^*\) (see Figure 3, right). Now applying \((1)\)
   to these cones leads to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem \((2)\).

   Figure 3. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem and its connection to (1).
   Indeed, \(\int_{S} K\,dS = A(C) \) by the definition of \(K\),
   and it only remains to explain why
   \(L(C^\ast)=\int_{\gamma}k\,ds\). Omitting the details, I will
   only mention that \(L(C^\ast)\) measures the angle by which
   \(n^*\) rotates in the tangent plane sliding along
   \(\gamma\), from the point of view of the observer walking
   around \(\gamma\). But \(n^*\) and \( \dot \gamma\) (the
   tangent to \(\gamma\)) rotate by the same amount, since the
   angle between them is unchanged after  one traversal of
   \(\gamma\); the latter  angle is \(\int_{ \gamma } k\,ds\) (by
   the definition of \(k\), which explains why \(\int_{ \gamma }
   k\, ds=L(C^\ast),\) and why \((2)\) indeed reduces to \((1)\).

   The wheel provides us with a mechanical interpretation of
   parallel transport (each spoke undergoes parallel transport if
   the wheel does not spin on its axis). Further details on this
   can be found in [1], and the more standard treatments of the
   Gauss-Bonnet theorem in [2] and [3].
