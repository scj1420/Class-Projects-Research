   The National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, is
   called [248]The Nation's Report Card for good reason; the tests
   are administered the same way year after year, using the same
   kind of test booklets, to students across the country.


   That allows researchers and educators to compare student
   progress over time. NAEP tests serve as a big research project
   to benchmark academic achievement in subjects like science,
   math, reading, writing, civics, economics, geography and U.S.
   history.

   Science results were out Thursday for 4th, 8th, and 12th
   graders.

   Among seniors, achievement was flat, and performance gaps by
   race, ethnicity and gender persisted.

   But fourth- and eighth-graders showed modest progress: each up
   four points since 2009.

   That's encouraging to U.S. Secretary of Education John King,
   who said in a press call, "We're seeing racial achievement gaps
   in the sciences narrowing in the fourth and eighth grades ...
   and the gender gaps also are closing."

   "All of this means that more students are developing skills
   like thinking critically, making sense of information and
   evaluating evidence," King said.

   The results got us wondering about the bigger picture: How well
   can a multiple-choice and short-answer test assess a subject as
   complicated as science?

   We reached out to science education experts to help us answer
   that question.

   Illustrated portrait of Nobel Laureate, Carl Wieman

   Carl Wieman is a Nobel Laureate who teaches in Stanford
   University's physics department and Graduate School of
   Education. He's an advocate for quality [250]active learning in
   science classes: limiting lecture and textbook time in favor of
   small-group problem solving, with the teacher as coach.


   He took a look at some [251]sample questions we sent to him,
   saying many of them are shallow, asking for recall of
   terminology or facts.


   "I've seen worse," Wieman tells us. "A lot worse."

   Still, he's not convinced the NAEP science tests meaningfully
   assess scientific thinking.

   "There is no concept at all of where a student might be able to
   use those facts or have any relevance in anyone's life, which
   for me is kind of more meaningful measures of learning."

   Sixteen states are in the process of adopting science standards
   that try to get students to think and ask questions just as
   scientists, engineers and physicists would.

   Questions


   They're called [254]Next Generation Science Standards; they're
   research-based, and de-emphasize the classic lecture, textbook,
   lab and test model of science teaching.


   Wieman says NAEP is missing a chance to help redirect science
   learning. "I see a real disconnect between these kinds of
   questions and what's called for in the standards."

   David Evans is the executive director of the National Science
   Teachers Association, which has been instrumental in creating
   the new science standards. His organization calls for "a
   dramatically more active learning process."

   This means students should be "confronted with a phenomena,
   asked to develop their own questions, and engage in the
   practices of science."

   But how do you check students' progress in this complex
   process? "Assessment is a real challenge," Evans says. The
   National Academy of Sciences [255]released a report that
   recommended states start with classroom-level performance
   assessments. But, says Evans, it's early days; national,
   benchmarked assessments don't yet exist. "No one has actually
   developed tools that the community feels comfortable with for
   assessing student progress under the new standards," he says.
