       – but does that mean much?


   Movies like to depict mathematicians as weirdos, but they
   usually miss the one legitimately weird thing about them: an
   extreme love of blackboards.

   Not whiteboards, not smartboards – blackboards. We’re talking
   chalk dust and erasers made of felt, like you had in elementary
   school.

   “If I walk to a room and see something written on a blackboard
   rather than a whiteboard, I’m more likely to assume it was done
   by a mathematician,” said Michael Barany, a postdoctoral fellow
   in the Department of History at Dartmouth, whose background is
   in mathematics and whose research examines the sociology of the
   field. “There are cases of a university where the
   administration is doing a building renovation or moving a
   department, and wanted to upgrade . . . and math departments
   have actively protested to keep their blackboards.”

   Barany knows because his research includes what strikes me as
   the most intriguing question I’ve heard in ages: Why do
   mathematicians like blackboards so much? And they surely do.

   In 2015, for example, the Japanese company that manufactured
   Hagoromo Fulltouch Chalk went out of business, and
   mathematicians around the world panicked because Hagoromo is
   widely considered the finest blackboard chalk in the world,
   producing clean lines and little dust. As Gizmodo reported, a
   Japanese TV station came to Stanford University to do a story
   about frantic mathematicians, one of who had stockpiled 15
   years’ worth of Hagoromo supplies.

   Closer to home, ponder a casual admission that Barany made in
   the midst of our conversion: “I have a collection of colored
   chalk I carry with me. You never know if there’s going to be
   good colored chalk where you’re going.”

   That is not something most people would say, unless they were
   kindergarteners or sidewalk artists. But among Barany’s
   publications and co-authorship of the 2014 study “Chalk:
   Materials and Concepts in Mathematics Research,” a 26-page
   analysis (with five pages of source notes) that includes
   sentences like “the formal rigor at the heart of mathematical
   order becomes indissociable from the ‘chalk in hand’ character
   of routine mathematical work.”

   What’s behind this phenomenon? Barany has a few hypotheses,
   some his own and some gathered from various sources:
   Tradition

   Serious mathematics has always been done on blackboards, so if
   your proof is written on some other wall-hanging device, it
   must not be serious mathematics.

   “There is definitely a mystique to a blackboard. Prestigious
   math departments prize putting blackboards in many places, as
   prominently as they reasonably can. A lot of places have
   blackboards in elevators – they don’t get used that much, part
   of it is just keeping up appearances of being a blackboard-y
   discipline,” Barany said.

   “Math (departments) often have blackboard in hallways. It’s a
   way you mark a space as (being) a place for mathematical
   collaboration.”

   There are even reports of blackboards in math building
   restrooms, although that might be rumors floated by jealous
   physicists.
   Noise

   “The sound of the chalk is loud enough, disruptive enough,
   sharp enough to have an active effect in turn-taking when
   someone’s presenting something to a group. This limits the
   allowable spaces for interruption; gives a certain control over
   the way a conversation plays out just by making a particular
   kind of noise,” he said. “You can talk over someone if they’re
   writing on a smartboard or a whiteboard, that’s a lot harder to
   do on a blackboard.”

   This tickled my fancy. The click-click-click when writing with
   chalk on blackboard is like no other sound out there, and I
   could see it affecting group dynamics in a way that would help
   research mathematics, the most information-dense communication
   system that humanity has ever devised. In mathematics, lack of
   interruption is important – unlike activities such as, say,
   writing a newspaper column, where any random schlub can chime
   in.
   Functionality

   “It’s hard to write small on a blackboard. That forces you to
   limit number of symbols, to have an economy of writing,” he
   said.

   Sounds reasonable, but Barany’s other functionality-related
   idea is a lot more fun: “The other thing about blackboards is
   that they smudge productively.”

   Smudge productively! I love it – but what does it mean?

   “Often a mathematical argument will involve taking some term or
   idea and rewriting it or rephrasing it in a fruitful way. You
   can do that by using an eraser or the side of your hand to rub
   out the thing you’ve rephrased and writing over it, but the
   smudge will still be visible. Being able to write over
   something while leaving visual evidence there was something
   before – is a nontrivial part of how mathematicians communicate
   those kinds of arguments.”

   Amazing. The inherent messiness of blackboards turns out to be
   a feature, not a bug.
   Physicality

   “People say, ‘I can write more quickly on a blackboard,’ ”
   Barany said. “They say, ‘I have to put my body into the
   writing, it brings it to life some way.’ ”

   And here’s a minor but non-zero benefit to using blackboards:
   “You can tell when chalk is about to run out in a way that you
   can’t tell when a whiteboard marker is about to run out.”

   All these answers are intriguing, but Barany says none is the
   answer. As with all things involving the behavior of the
   universe’s most complex system, – human beings – the variables
   are so numerous and the interactions so tangled that it’s
   almost impossible to sort them out.

   What’s most intriguing is that these “fuzzy” sociology and
   psychology factors (fuzzy to a hard-science fan, anyway) are
   important in the development of the purest of human activities:
   high-level mathematics. Math often seems to be nothing less
   than truth itself freed from the constraints and biases of
   carbon-based life forms. “Euclid alone has looked on beauty
   bare,” as the poet Edna St. Vincent Millay famously put it.

   But Barany said that’s not really true. Math, he notes, is done
   by humans and should be viewed through the prism of humanity,
   through the realities of the person he calls “the witness,” or
   the mathematician who makes a finding.

   “People think that it shouldn’t matter who the witness is as a
   person – that the character of the witness is not what makes
   the evidence reliable. . . . But one learns very quickly about
   mathematicians is that this is not how mathematicians share
   ideas, and it’s not how research takes place. It ends up
   looking a lot more like other kinds of witnessing, that are
   better understood,” he said.

   If the witness is more comfortable or more effective or more
   likely to be understood when using the compressed skeletal
   remains of sea creatures to write on thin sheets of slate, then
   so be it. If nothing else, it’s a celebration of the
   technology’s staying power in our here-today-gone-tomorrow
   world.

   “It’s unlikely that blackboards will be used 50 years from now
   in the same way they are used today, but it’s a good bet
   they’ll be used 50 years from now in some way,” Barany said.

   One place he hopes they’ll be used, incidentally, is his new
   home in Dartmouth’s history department.

   “I’m trying to commandeer a blackboard for the hallway.”
