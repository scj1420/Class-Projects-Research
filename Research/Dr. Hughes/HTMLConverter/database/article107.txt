Analyzing Multiple Time Scales in Two-Dimensional Fluids Using
Dynamical Systems

   By [47]Margaret Beck and [48]C. Eugene Wayne


   The time scales over which fluids evolve have a critical effect
   on the physical systems in which they occur. These time scales
   arise from an interplay of different effects, some of
   which—like Lagrangian coherent structures—tend to stabilize the
   flow, while others, such as shear (inviscid) damping or viscous
   damping, tend to break down structures, at least on
   small-length scales. A variety of recent investigations, many
   of which involve a dynamical systems point of view, have begun
   to shed light on the origin of these time scales in the case of
   two-dimensional fluid flows. Since the basic questions of
   existence and uniqueness for two-dimensional fluid flows are
   well understood, one can ask more detailed queries about their
   evolution. Moreover, these flows have a tendency to form large,
   vortical structures on both laboratory and geophysical scales,
   as seen in Figure 1, a satellite photo of the Gulf Stream.
   Dynamical systems theory is well suited to answer these types
   of questions since invariant families of solutions often appear
   to organize the dynamics, effectively creating the multiple
   time scales and observed asymptotic behavior [3, 5]. In simple
   settings, invariant manifolds [4, 9] can even characterize this
   organization.

   A particularly important example of this is the two-dimensional
   incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with small viscosity, \(0
   \ll \nu < 1 \):

   \[ \partial_t \omega + {\bf u}\cdot \nabla \omega = \nu \Delta
   \omega, \quad  \omega = \omega(x,t), \quad  x \in \Omega
   \subseteq {\bf R}^2.\]

   Here, \(\omega\) is the vorticity of the fluid and
   \(\bf{u}\) is the fluid velocity, recoverable from the
   vorticity via the Biot-Savart law. In other words, \(\omega =
   (\nabla \times \mathbf{u}) \cdot (0,0,1)\). When \(\nu=0\), the
   equation reduces to the Euler equation, which has infinitely
   many stationary solutions. Though these no longer remain
   stationary states for positive (but small) vorticity, it is
   reasonable to believe that they still play an important role in
   the longtime evolution of the Navier-Stokes equation. However,
   most stationary states of the Euler equation are surprisingly
   never observed in the Navier-Stokes evolution. Instead, a small
   number of the Euler states become quasi-stationary states of
   Navier-Stokes, and only a subset of these seem to have
   long-term influence. As a first “guess” at the time scales over
   which the viscosity makes itself felt, one can note that the
   two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations on
   \(\mathbb{R}^2\) have a family of exact solutions known as the
   Oseen vortices, given by

   \[\omega^O(x,t) = \frac{A}{1+t} e^{-\frac{|x|^2}{4 \nu
   (1+t)}}.\]

   From this formula, it seems as if the viscosity should be
   perceptible on a time scale

   \[t_{visc} \sim \frac{1}{\nu}.\]

   However, numerical experiments indicate that vortices and other
   large-scale characteristic structures emerge in the flow on a
   much shorter time scale. For instance, in the numerical
   simulation of Figure 2 [10], the viscous time scale would be
   \(t_{visc} \sim 1500\), but large-scale vortical structures
   emerge on a much shorter time scale. Understanding the origin
   of these scales is currently a question of great interest.

   There is presently no mathematical theory predicting which of
   the Euler solutions will play the most important role in the
   viscous evolution. However, a finite subset of these
   quasi-stationary states correspond to an explicit family that
   decays on the viscous time scale \(\mathcal{O}(e^{-\nu
   t})\) and can be described by the lowest four Fourier modes,
   \(\{e^{\pm ix}, e^{\pm iy}\}\). Bar states (also known as
   Komogorov flow, a type of shear flow) are solutions that vary
   only in the \(x\) or only in the \(y\) direction, while dipoles
   vary in both directions. Researchers have observed, both
   experimentally and numerically, that most initial conditions
   lead to solutions which originally experience rapid evolution
   to either a bar state or a dipole, followed by slow decay to
   the background rest state (zero solution). A classical approach
   to analyzing such behavior begins by linearizing the
   Navier-Stokes equation about a bar state or dipole and
   attempting to determine the rate of convergence to the state,
   which should correspond to the observed initial period of rapid
   evolution. This type of linearization near a bar state [5]
   suggests that the rapid evolution occurs on the time scale
   \(\mathcal{O}(e^{-\sqrt{\nu}t})\), at least at the linear
   level. Interestingly, the linearization leads to a highly
   non-self-adjoint operator, making it unclear whether the
   multiple time scale phenomenon is spectral or pseudospectral. A
   dynamical systems perspective is useful in this analysis
   because it permits a separation between the decay rate to the
   invariant family, at \(\mathcal{O}(e^{-\sqrt{\nu}t})\), and the
   decay rate within the family, at \(\mathcal{O}(e^{-\nu t})\).


   A related work also analyzes the rapid convergence to bars and
   dipoles using a dynamical systems perspective [3]. Researchers
   take the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation, written in
   Fourier space, and formally project that system onto the lowest
   eight modes: the lower four contain the bars and dipoles and
   the next four model the effects of all higher modes. They then
   use classical dynamical systems techniques, including invariant
   manifolds and estimates involving Duhamel’s formula, to study
   the resulting eight-dimensional ordinary differential equation
   (ODE). This method focuses on understanding the effects of
   perturbing the domain from a square torus, represented by a
   parameter \(\delta = 1\), to a rectangular torus, represented
   by \(\delta \neq 1\). The parameter \(\delta\) controls whether
   a particular invariant manifold is a center \((\delta = 1)\),
   stable \((\delta <1)\), or unstable \((\delta>1)\)
   manifold, which then determines if the dominant
   quasi-stationary state was a dipole, \(y\)-bar state, or
   \(x\)-bar state, respectively. In this ODE model, the initial
   period of rapid decay notably occurred on the time scale
   \(\mathcal{O}(e^{-t/\nu})\) instead of time scale
   \(\mathcal{O}(e^{-\sqrt{\nu}t})\), which researchers observed
   in the previously-mentioned work.


   The dynamical systems perspective sheds light not only on the
   question of multiple time scales in fluids, but on other
   aspects of their motion as well. For example, one can analyze
   the stability and interaction of vortices in the planar
   Navier-Stokes equation with limit \(\nu \to 0\) using a point
   vortex model [11]. A key aspect of that work is its ability to
   capture the higher-order effects of vortex interaction, showing
   that for motions in which the centers of vorticity were
   initially well-separated, the essentially inviscid motion of
   the vortex cores accurately described the overall nature of the
   flow until the distance between vortices became comparable to
   the size of the vortex core. Interestingly, such configurations
   of near point vortices appear in a host of experimental
   circumstances (see Figure 3) [1].

   In work more closely related to the above discussion about bar
   state metastability [6], researchers studied solutions of the
   two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in a neighborhood of
   Couette flow, a particular type of shear flow in a channel.
   Using careful partial differential equation (PDE) estimates in
   Gevrey spaces, they were able to treat the full nonlinear
   problem. This work is particularly interesting because it
   identifies precisely different time scales associated with an
   initial period of so-called inviscid damping—in which the Euler
   equations essentially govern flow—followed by a rapid evolution
   due to enhanced diffusion and then a final, slow period of
   convergence to the Couette flow, during which viscosity
   dominates. The intermediate period of enhanced diffusion
   relates to the hypocoercivity in [5, 8], and is further
   connected to the phenomenon of Taylor dispersion, which also
   occurs in the channel setting but for different boundary
   conditions. Originally studied in the 1950s, Taylor dispersion
   is another example of a situation in which shearing in the
   ambient flow field enhances dispersive or dissipative effects.


   Researchers have recently attacked this problem from two
   different perspectives using dynamical systems ideas. In [7],
   hypocoercivity methods are used to analyze the decay
   enhancement in a variety of shearing flows. In [2], more
   classical dynamical systems methods like invariant manifolds
   play a key role, but not in an entirely straightforward way.
   Although the PDE does not seem to possess an invariant
   manifold—in fact, evidence suggests that it does not—its
   solutions are shown to be well-approximated by solutions to an
   ODE that does possess a center manifold, on which the enhanced
   diffusion can be computed explicitly. This matches Taylor’s
   original formal calculations from the 1950s.
