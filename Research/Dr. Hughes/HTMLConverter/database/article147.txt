   Yes, I’ve started a new blog.  The platform here at WordPress
   seems to be nicer and more versatile.  I’ll be blogging here
   from now on.

   However, my first blog post was at Blogger, because that
   platform was easy and I was a blogging novice.

   “The Lesson of Grace in Teaching”
   -teaching.html


   The piece went viral, and has been my most popular piece of
   writing.  It was eventually published in print in [13]The Best
   Writing on Mathematics 2014.   I will leave that blog post
   where it is, so people know where to find it, but I’m including
   a pointer to it here because it really does explain who I am
   and how I think about teaching.
