   Instagram, lately:
   [89](35 grad students + 5 days + 1 house) × #homotopytheory = 1
   healthy dose of #mathematics. . Up there is a snapshot of some
   scribbles from this year's MIT Talbot Workshop where I heard
   all about 'obstruction theory for structured ring spectra.' (We
   took over a big house in the middle of nowhere, duct-taped some
   whiteboards to the wall, and did #math for a week!) . The
   “structure" is encoded by these gadgets called operads (a
   portmanteau of opera + monad) which have applications in many
   areas of math: #algebra (e.g. vertex algebras, quantum
   algebra), #algebraictopology (e.g. string topology, homotopy
   groups of spheres), #differentialgeometry (e.g. fluid
   mechanics, Kähler manifolds), #algebraicgeometry (e.g. moduli
   spaces of algebraic curves, Frobenius manifolds), and
   name a few! . While I don't know much about ring spectra, I do
   know a little about operads, and they're what I plan to blog
   about next! Hoping to have some down-time soon so I can write
   it all up! (35 grad students + 5 days + 1 house) ×

   [90](Drumroll please... 🥁) Alright y'all, here it is! Right now
   on the blog, I’m answering that frequently asked question:
   “What’s up with all the note-taking?!?” I’ve put the link in my
   profile! . In today's post, I outline a step-by-step process
   that I tried to follow during my last few years of college and
   first two years of grad school. It goes a little something like
   this: . Step 1: Read the appropriate chapter/section in the
   book before class. (Fun fact: all my books/PDFs are littered
   with writing in the margins.) . Step 2: Attend lecture and take
   notes. (Another fun fact: I write down MUCH more than what the
   professor writes on the board… also, in this part of the blog
   post, I provide the links to my favorite notebooks, pens, and
   pencils! Yes, the very ones you see in all my IG photos 😉) .
   Step 3: Rewrite lecture notes. (This is the step in which most
   of my learning happens. ) . Step 4: Do homework problems. (This
   is really priority, even though I've listed it as step #4. As a
   wise person once said, “The only way to learn math is to DO
   math.”) . But these steps are only the skeleton! All of the
   juicy bits are on the blog. (I can't fit 'em all into a little
   IG post.) I do hope I've answered all your questions. Go check
   it out and let me know! Hope you enjoy :) [Link to the blog
   post “Some Notes on Taking Notes” in profile.] . PS: another
   nice thing about taking so many notes is that you get to make
   cool photos 👆😎 (Drumroll please... 🥁) Alright y'all, here it

   [91]Well I think it’s safe to say I learned a lot this
   semester. A LOT. And now there’s so much to blog about.
   Eeeeeep! Where do I even begin?! Limits/colimits? Adjunctions?
   Kan extensions? Operads? (There’s the little cubes operad and
   colored operads and Riemann surfaces as operads and… a swiss
   cheese operad?!) Associahedra? A-infinity algebras? Simplicial
   sets? Factorization homology? All the above!?! *gasps for air*
   Such cool stuff, y'all. . Ps. I'm also thinking about blogging
   on how I take notes/study math. Turns out this is one of the
   most frequently asked questions. Because apparently people
   think I like to take notes. Can't imagine why though. Heh. 😉 .
   Good luck to everyone taking finals exams and/or quals! (And
   congrats if you're done!) Well I think it’s safe to say I

   [92]In my last post, I mentioned something about a 1-line proof
   that the fundamental group of the circle (i.e. all the ways you
   can wrap a circle around itself) is basically just the
   integers: …, -2, -1 , 0 , 1 , 2,…. Well, here it is! . I’ve
   include TWO (very condensed) versions of the proof in the
   pictures above: the “I have no idea what she’s talking about,
   but this sounds really cool” version. And the “I’ve taken a
   course in #algebraictopology and know a little #categorytheory
   version.” Version 1 is in white, version 2 is in gray. Hope you
   enjoy :) Feel free to ask any questions in the comments! . And

   [93]Once upon a time, I wrote a six-part (🙈!) blog series on
   why the fundamental group (i.e. the group of "holes" of) the
   circle is ℤ, the integers. (Intuitively, because you can wrap a
   circle around itself 0 or 1 or 2 or 3,... times in either the
   clockwise or counterclockwise direction.) . I now know a
   one-line proof. . One. Line. . Very blog-worthy 😏 (Hint: loop
   spaces + fibrations!) . On a different note, good luck to
   everyone studying for the qualifying exams! (If you're
   wondering, "What are these 'quals' anyway?" check out the link
   in bio!) . [Pictured above: today's notes on #topology
   (factorization homology!), #algebra (algebras over operads!),
   and #categorytheory (homotopy (co)limits!)... all to appear on
   the blog this summer, hopefully 🤞 😎] Once upon a time, I wrote

   [94]Cannot! Contain!! Excitement!!! Today my advisor gave me a
   paper (a journal article) to read. It relates to some very cool
   things like topological quantum field theory and gauge theory
   and manifold topology and higher category theory (*squeee!*)
   and a plethora of other mathematical physics-y things that I do
   not understand (so don't ask me about the details yet 😉), and
   ohmygoshyouguys I’m starting to droolallovermyphone 🤤 because I
   am so excited!!!!! . I first became interested in mathematical
   physics seven years ago. At that time, I knew I wanted attend
   graduate school so that I could (slowly) build the foundation
   necessary to (start to) understand the language and ideas used.
   I'm still not there yet: it’s a work in (very slow 🐌) progress,
   and I have a long (long!) ways to go. But I was quite surprised
   (and kinda blown away) when I flipped through that paper today
   and realized, “Snap! I actually know what some of these words
   mean!” . Long story short, grad school takes a lot of hard
   work, but I am *immensely* grateful for the opportunity to do
   so. The #math is really quite thrilling! . Alright, well,
   unfortunately I didn't have a cool math-physics picture to
   share (unless you want to see more of my notes 😏), so here’s a
   photo of a subway station near my apartment. It’s got lots of
   cool #geometry going on. ;) . #EnduranceIsKey Cannot! Contain!!

   [95]How cool is this! The 3D associahedra! In short, it
   (topologically) captures the 14 ways you can ‘multiply’ 5
   things. . You see, when we write down a∙b∙c∙d∙e, it may not be
   clear what we mean. Do we first multiply a∙b, then multiply by
   c, then d, then e? Or do we first multiply c∙d, then multiply
   by b on the left, then e on the right, then a on the left? Of
   course, if a,b,c,d,e are numbers, then it doesn’t matter:
   multiplication in ℝ is associative. . BUT there lots of
   mathematical gadgets *besides* numbers that we can combine with
   a "multiplication" ∙ that is not associative! (For instance,
   the cross product of vectors in ℝ³.) So the associahedra help
   keep track of how the different ways of placing your
   parentheses are related to one another. . The solid polytope
   above has 14 vertices, 20 edges, and 9 faces (6 pentagonal, 3
   rectangular). (In topology-lingo, it’s a cell complex.) Each
   vertex represents a way of putting parentheses around (i.e.
   associating) 5 elements: for starters, you have a vertex for
   (((a∙b)∙c)∙d)∙e, and another for a∙(b∙(c∙(d∙e))). And your
   remaining vertices are for everything in between! . And there’s
   an edge between two vertices if you can get from one to the
   other by an ‘association’ of 3 elements. For instance, there’s
   an edge between (((a∙b)∙c)∙d)∙e and ((a∙(b∙c))∙d)∙e to keep
   track of the move (a∙b)∙c a∙(b∙c). The faces of the polytope
   represent the various associations of 4 elements. (ONE of which
   was shown in my previous post!) . On the left was my attempt at
   drawing the polytope, but today I ran into someone who made a
   3D one with paper and staples! (You can use graph theory and
   label everything with trees - that's what you see there.) .
   Needless to say, I was pretty stoked. 😄And of course there's
   much more to the story here, but perhaps I'll save it for
   another day :) How cool is this! The 3D associahedra! In short,
