   If you've ever endured time away from someone you love, you
   know how much of it comes down to simple emotions and math:
   heartache and counting down the days until you're reunited.
   That's the premise behind one of the year's most infectious
   songs, "Emotions And Math," from one of the year's best new
   artists, [224]Margaret Glaspy.


   Now, in a new video for the song, Glaspy takes an office job,
   where she finds it hard to keep her mind on her work.

   "I've never worked a desk job and this was my one opportunity,"
   Glaspy tells NPR Music in an email. "At some point in your
   life, you miss someone with all your heart, whether it be your
   mom on the first day of school or a long-distance relationship.
   Touring constantly, I know this feeling well."

   As the video unfolds, Glaspy builds an ever-growing collage of
   wall art with mementos from the person she misses — postcards,
   photos and souvenirs — until the whole thing looks like a wild
   mix of ciphers right out of A Beautiful Mind.

   "Immediately after hearing the song, I knew I had to make a
   video for it," says director Claire Vogel. "Being in a
   long-distance relationship myself, I couldn't help but relate
   to Margaret's lyrics and felt inspired by my own similar
   experiences. In order to make the wall as big, and as special
   to a long-distance love story as possible, I even brought in
   some personal love notes, postcards and sentimental
   knick-knacks to fill out the space. There's a lot of tape and a
   lot of love on that wall."
