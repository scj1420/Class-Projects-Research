A Stanford math professor encourages a different teaching approach


   First Daughter [9]Ivanka Trump and Education Secretary Betsy
   DeVos toured the National Air and Space Museum with a group of
   middle school students Tuesday, encouraging girls to pursue
   careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics —
   even while President Donald Trump’s administration put forth a
   [10]budget proposal that suggests cutting funding for education
   and research. There is nothing more important than advancing
   the STEM fields — and those groups who are underrepresented
   within them.


   One area in desperate need of examination is the way we teach
   mathematics. Many Americans suffer from misconceptions about
   math. They think people are either born with a “math brain” or
   not — an idea that has been [11]disproven — and that
   mathematics is all numbers, procedures and speedy thinking. In
   reality, mathematicians spend most of their working lives
   thinking slowly and deeply, investigating complex patterns in
   multiple dimensions. We sacrifice many people — women and
   students of color, in particular — at the altar of these myths
   about math.


   Math is a prerequisite for most STEM fields, and the reason
   many students abandon STEM careers. In higher levels of
   mathematics, gender imbalances persist: In 2015, about 76% of
   math doctorates were awarded to men. This figure should prompt
   alarm in mathematics departments across the country — and
   encourage focus on an area that is shockingly neglected in
   discussions of equity: teaching methods in classrooms.

   At Stanford University, I teach some of the country’s highest
   achievers. But when they enter fast-paced lecture halls, even
   those who were successful in high school mathematics start to
   think they’re not good enough. One of my undergraduates
   described the panic she felt when trying to keep pace with a
   professor: “The material felt like it was flying over my head,”
   she wrote. “It was like I was watching a lecture at 2x or 3x
   speed and there was no way to pause or replay it.” She
   described her fear of failure as “crippling.” This student
   questioned her intelligence and started to rethink whether she
   belonged in the field of math at all.

   [12]Research tells us that lecturers typically speak at between
   100 and 125 words a minute, but students can take note of only
   about 20 words a minute, often leaving them feeling frustrated
   and defeated. “I’ve essentially given up in my math class right
   now,” another student of mine wrote. “In such a fast-paced
   environment where information is constantly coming at you,
   there just isn’t time to think deeply about what you are
   learning.”


   The irony of the widespread emphasis on speed in math
   classrooms, with damaging timed tests given to students from an
   early age, is that some of the world’s most successful
   mathematicians describe themselves as slow thinkers. In his
   [13]autobiography, Laurent Schwartz, winner of the world’s
   [14]highest award in mathematics, described feeling “stupid” in
   school because he was a slow thinker. “I was always deeply
   uncertain about my own intellectual capacity; I thought I was
   unintelligent,” he wrote. “And it is true that I was, and still
   am, rather slow. I need time to seize things because I always
   need to understand them fully.”


   When students struggle in speed-driven math classes, they often
   believe the problem lies within themselves, not realizing that
   fast-paced lecturing is a faulty teaching method. The students
   most likely to [15]internalize the problem are women and
   students of color. This is one of the main reasons that these
   students choose not to go forward in mathematics and other STEM
   subjects, and likely why a [16]study found that in 2011,
   [17]74% of the STEM workforce was male and [18]71% was white.


   Women are just as capable as men of working at high speed, of
   course, but I’ve found in my own research that they are more
   likely to reject subjects that do not give access to [19]deep
   understanding. The deep understanding that women seek, and are
   often denied, is exactly what we need to encourage in students
   of mathematics. I have taught many deep, slow thinkers in
   mathematics classes over the years. Often, but not always, they
   are women, and many decide they cannot succeed in mathematics.
   But when the message about mathematics has changed to emphasize
   slower, deeper processing, I’ve seen many of these women go on
   to excel in STEM careers.


   When mathematics classes become places where students explore
   ideas, more often than they watch procedures being rapidly
   demonstrated by a teacher or professor, we will start to
   liberate students from feelings of inadequacy. In a recent
   [20]summer camp with 81 middle school students, we taught
   mathematics through open, creative lessons to demonstrate how
   mathematics is about thinking deeply, rather than calculating
   quickly. After 18 lessons, the students improved their
   mathematics achievement on standardized tests by an average of
   50%, the equivalent of 1.6 years of school. If classrooms
   across the country would dispel the myths about math and teach
   differently, we would improve the lives of many students and
   enable the creation of a more diverse STEM workforce. It will
   take a generation of young, creative, adaptable and
   quantitative thinkers to tackle our society’s problems —
   thinkers that we are currently turning away from mathematics
   classrooms and lecture halls in droves.
