What is a manifold? Yet another article! (1/6)

   Why (yet) another article?

   There are competing theories online about possible
   interpretations of John von Neumann’s quote, but manifolds are
   definitely some mathematics that “you don’t understand … you
   just get used to them,” — at least for a while.

   In a series of posts reflecting on my own experience, I will
   try to motivate the conceptualization of manifolds, and
   the implications such an abstraction has/had on our
   understanding of, basically, shapes. I hope to point to some
   beautiful geometry in low dimensions that you may have passed
   by too quickly to take notice of.

   I must underline the subjective nature of my articles, and that
   by no means are they meant to narrate the history of the
   subject, or depict a current fashion in the community. This is
   simply “another article.”

   The first three articles will be dedicated to converting the
   conventional calculus of curves into manifold language. We will
   see that a curve can be replaced by an interval endowed with
   some structure. This will pave the way for an exposition of the
   theory of surfaces in subsequent articles. The reason for such
   an extended sequence is to include as much detail and as many
   examples as possible.


   The Question
   curve-through-space

   What We Know from Calculus

   From calculus we fix a Cartesian coordinate system for
   three-space and then parameterize our curve by a map from a
   subset of \mathbb{R} ,

   \gamma: \mathbb{I} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^3.

   If \gamma is a smooth parameterization, then the length of the
   object between two of its points  P=\gamma (c)  and  Q=\gamma
   (d) is given by

   \int _c^d \| \gamma '(t) \|dt.

   The curvature is given by

   k(t)=\dfrac{|\gamma ' \wedge \gamma''|}{|\gamma '|^3}

   and the torsion is given by

   \tau (t) = -\dfrac{ (\gamma ' \wedge \gamma'') \cdot \gamma
   '''}{|\gamma ' \wedge \gamma ''|^2}

   where differentiation is taken coordinate-wise.

   Notice that the integral above involves only the length of
   \gamma '(t) . Thus, even if we don’t have \gamma  itself , but
   only some \ell (t) =\| \gamma '(t) \| \in \mathbb{R} , we will
   again be able to measure the length of any segment of  our
   curve.

   This observation invites a search for a representation of our
   curves independent of the three-space.


   The Answer to the Question

   In a search for a 1-dimensional embodiment of a curve, the
   following theorem is the best we could hope for.

   Theorem: Given differentiable real-valued functions \ell (t) >0
   , k(t)>0 and \tau (t) , with t ranging in an interval I , there
   is a curve \gamma :I \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^3 with k being
   its curvature and \tau being its torsion and \int \ell giving
   its length between points. Moreover, any other curve with this
   description is obtained by changing our origin and rotating the
   axes rigidly. (See Chapter 1 of do Carmo’s book Differential
   Geometry of Curves and Surfaces.)

   Thanks to this theorem, an interval I along with the following
   set of data can be thought of as a curve in \mathbb{R}^3 :
       the length,
       curvature, and,
       the torsion.

   Note that this data is independent of the specific positioning
   of our curve in 3-space.


   So far…

   A curve in  \mathbb{R}^3 is nothing more than an interval in
   \mathbb{R} along with three real-valued functions defined on
   it! Once we have this set of data, we can forget about our
   original curve as a subset of  \mathbb{R}^3 , and work in
   1-dimension.  After all, we can reconstruct an exact copy of
   our curve in 3-space from the data whenever we wish.


   In the Next Installment…
       curves, that this description makes possible;
       determine the same curve, which will allow for the
       definition of 1-manifolds in the following article.
