   Solitary waves called solitons are one of nature's great
   curiosities: Unlike other waves, these lone wolf waves keep
   their energy and shape as they travel, instead of dissipating
   or dispersing as most other waves do.

   In a new paper in Physical Review Letters (PRL), a team of
   mathematicians, physicists and engineers tackles a famous,
   50-year-old problem tied to these enigmatic entities.

   The puzzle dates back to 1965, when physicists Norman Zabusky
   and Martin Kruskal came up with a surprising solution to the
   Korteweg-de Vries equation, which serves as a mathematical
   model for describing nonlinear waves in shallow water.

   Using a computer, Zabusky and Kruskal generated an approximate
   solution to the equation that featured eight independent,
   particle-like waves. Each of these waves retained its form and
   speed over time and distance -- even after colliding with other
   such waves. The colleagues coined the term "soliton" to
   describe these unusual entities, giving birth to modern
   research in this field.

   Kruskal and others then went on to invent a new mathematical
   method to solve the Korteweg-de Vries equation exactly.
   However, the calculations needed to obtain concrete answers are
   complex, typically requiring the use of a computer to complete
   -- thus limiting scientists' ability to understand phenomena,
   including Zabusky and Kruskal's 1965 solution, says University
   at Buffalo mathematician Gino Biondini.

   Moreover, to Biondini's knowledge, the original wave pattern
   that Zabusky and Kruskal described in 1965 has never been fully
   reproduced in the physical world (though earlier experiments
   have managed to generate portions of the solution).

   The new PRL study, published Sept. 28, addresses both of these
   problems, says Biondini, a co-author on the paper.

   A new approach to an old problem

   With Guo Deng, a UB PhD candidate in physics, Biondini
   developed a mathematical approach that produces an approximate
   solution to the equation that Zabusky and Kruskal tackled in
   the 1960s. The new approach enables researchers to make
   explicit, accurate predictions about how many solitons will
   emerge in a given setting, as well as what features these waves
   will have, such as their amplitude and speed.

   The method's simplicity means that researchers can use it to
   gain a better mathematical understanding of soliton formation
   in these kinds of situations, Biondini says.

   "Zabusky and Kruskal's famous work from the 1960s gave rise to
   the field of soliton theory," says Biondini, a professor of
   mathematics in the UB College of Arts and Sciences. "But until
   now, we lacked a simple explanation for what they described.
   Our method gives you a full description of the solution that
   they observed, which means we can finally gain a better
   understanding of what's happening."

   Making waves

   While Biondini and Deng worked on the theoretical side of the
   problem, colleagues in Europe and Japan put their math to the
   test in real-world experiments as part of the same paper.

   Led by Italian scientists Miguel Onorato and Stefano Trillo of
   the University of Turin and the University of Ferrara,
   respectively, the team ran experiments in a 110-meter-long
   water tank in Berlin using a computer-assisted wave generator.
   The wave patterns they produced matched well with Biondini and
   Deng's predictions, and included the original eight-soliton
   solution described by Zabusky and Kruskal so many years before
   (though it should be noted that water waves do begin to lose
   some energy after traveling over long distances, and are
   therefore only approximately solitons).

   "Previous experiments had produced parts of the famous results
   from 1965, but, as far as I know, they all had limitations,"
   Onorato says. "We were able to generate the solution more
   fully, including all eight solitons. We were also able to
   experimentally generate another feature observed in
   multi-soliton solutions, namely the strange phenomenon of
   recurrence, in which a wave pattern transitions from its
   initial state to a state with several solitons and back again
   to the original state. This is akin to placing a bunch of
   children in a room to play, then returning later to find that
   the room has been returned to its initial, tidy state after a
   period of messiness."
