   [19]Illuminated magnifier[20] [4125jKe2dDL-1-12.jpg?w=970] I
   bought this illuminated handheld magnifier on Amazon for $3
   (free shipping) last year and I use it a lot. It's a great
   splinter and lice checker. I've gotten my $3 of value from it
   just looking at tiny bugs and skin abnormalities. It has two
   built in LEDs and uses two AA batteries.

   [23]Squatty Potty[24] [KeXMN9.gif?w=970] Squatty Potty is a $28
   footstool that slides away under your toilet; you use it to
   bring your knees up to a squatting position while you poop,
   which makes pooping much, much easier. The product was launched
   with the best viral ad campaign of all time, which threaded the
   seemingly impossible needle of making an ad about a
   poop-assistance product; I bought one and (without getting into
   detail) I can personally testify to its efficacy.

   [27]Nintendo NES Classic Edition[28]
   [nes-classic-edition-12.png?w=970] What’s Christmas without
   price gouging on the hottest geek gift of the year! Don’t fret.
   Soon, the rationing will cease and a $60 NES Classic Edition
   will be just a click away. And then, Mario my old friend, we
   will ALL be playing with power.

   happy foodie horizons. Shove entire fruits and veggies into the
   giant feed tube. Listen to the 720-watt motor fill a 14-cup
   work bowl with steel slicing and shredding discs. It still

   colors; the dev community is more mature and there are
   countless games already.

   great David Bowie who played it to great effect on “Space

   a great deal for the price. The lamp is very bright (you can
   dim it, or make it strobe) and you can point the beam up or
   down. It's also got a motion activated switch so you don't gave
   to fumble for the button - just wave your hand in front of the
   beam to activate or deactivate it.

   [68]iPad Pro 9.7"[69] [61TRipS22B3L._SL1200_-12.jpg?w=970] The
   larger, pencil-equipped models are as close to being fit for
   heavy creative duty as tablets get, but the 12.9" model is so
   large it suffers by comparison to Apple's splendidly tiny 12"
   MacBook (and Microsoft's tablet PCs, to be plainly honest) for
   many tasks. But the 9.7" model is just perfect: big enough to
   paint on, small enough to not feel like you're carrying around
   a computer, but with all the power offered by its big sister.

   the best selling hand vac for keeping your office, home,
   workshop or hackerspace tidy. CHV1410L has strong suction, and
   a bagless dirt bowl that's easy to see and empty. Holds a
   charge for up to 18 months when it's off the charger. High
   efficiency Lithium ion chargers protect it by automatically
   shutting off when the battery is charged, so you can store it
   on the charger.

   Dipping your stylus into this firm, gelatinous lump removes any

   The plastic lid is a magnifier for a before and after view.
   Imported from Japan, complete with kanji on the packaging.

   [80]Surface Book[81] [712RG-x0YaL._SL1500_-12.jpg?w=970] The
   best convertible tablet PC by a mile, Microsoft's Surface is
   beautiful, powerful and well-designed, especially the balance
   between keyboard and display. RAM is limited to 16GB, and the
   custom GPU from NVidia really isn't up to snuff for gaming, but
   it's the second-best tool for fat-walleted artists wanting to
   move on from Wacom. (The best is the [82]Surface Studio
   Desktop, but they're not shipping until the new year)

   cartridges to run out. Each print using the Polaroid ZINK photo
   paper runs about 50 cents and has a peelable sticker backing.
   No need to shake the prints when they come out either because,
   well, that never did anything anyway.

   first Aeropress in 2010; since then, I've been an out-and-out
   evangelist for them. Nothing makes a better cup of coffee, and
   you can literally buy a hundred of these for the cost of a
   midrange espresso machine. Every Aeropress cup I've ever made
   has been perfect. I keep one in my suitcase. I buy spare ones
   to keep at the houses of people I stay with on the road. I gave
   one to my parents. If you want to give a gift to a
   coffee-lover, give that person an Aeropress. Seriously.

   [71zejgw4v1L._SL1500_-12.jpg?w=970] I bought the Brondell
   Source in 2015 and it alleviated allergy symptoms; here's the
   latest model, adding a touchscreen, remote control and an
   adjustable air quality sensor. Rids the air of dust and dander
   and tiny particles you don’t need to be breathing—but also
   filters volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Three-stage advanced
   purifier system includes certified True HEPA and Granulated
   Carbon technology. Glowing light indicator tells you when it’s
   working. One time my dog farted a particularly noxious plume
   and this thing kicked into high gear with an emergency red
   glow. That’s when I knew I’d be giving it a five star
   recommendation in our gift guide.

   This is the single most gorgeous example of practical
   retromania I've seen all year, a weird and wonderful mashing
   together of American decades. Sadly, it's not clear if it's a
   product yet or just a prototype; rich players can drop creators
   8bitdo a line and see what's possible in time for Christmas.
   For the rest of us, their [103]other clever retro recreations
   are quite inexpensive.

   Super Starter Kit comes with a bunch of different components,
   including sensors, a servo motor, a stepper motor, a joystick,
   a breadboard, and lots more. Most of the reviewers say that the
   Elegoo UNO is a good Arduino Uno clone. The one thing people
   have complained about is the tutorials. They say they are
   poorly written. That's not a problem because there are lots of
   great Arduino books, and I have a [112]video class on getting
   started with Arduino on Skillshare that is highly rated. At
   $32, the components alone are worth the price.

   Shark Rocket is more compact and manoeverable. The wide,

   great gift that can be stashed in a desk drawer and whipped out
   for some vacuuming fun whenever the need arises.

   available in gold and rose gold, to go with your gadgets. Set
   up an auto-timer with the flick of a button, and they turn on
   and off automatically every day at the same time from that day
   on. Better than actual candles for three reasons: a thousand
   hours glow time per battery pair, you don’t have to go around
   your house and light each one, and you don't have to worry
   about accidentally burning your house down. Each wax candle has
   a soft ombre design that fades from dark to light. They smell
   faintly of vanilla, in the nicest way.

   FryDaddy electric deep fryer ($22 on Amazon) like crazy after
   buying it earlier this year. I fill it with coconut oil and fry
   Brussels sprout leaves, sweet potato slices, and butternut
   squash fries.


   Lately I've been frying thinly cut slices of butternut squash.
   It's a bit tricky, because for five minutes it doesn't look
   like anything is happening, then suddenly the slices begin to
   brown, and about a minute later, they start to burn. There's a
   30-second window where they are perfectly browned and on the
   edge of being crispy and chewy. With a little salt, they are
   one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten.

   [173]RFID Blocking Leather Slim Wallet[174]
   [wallet-1-12.jpg?w=970] I bought this leather wallet for $6
   from Amazon a month ago. I liked it right away, and after
   having taken about eight flights since then, I have come to
   appreciate how great it is to be able to slide my driver
   license out of the clear plastic pocket (which has a hole so
   you can remove the card by sliding it with your thumb) and hand
   it to the friendly TSA officer at the security checkpoint.


   The wallet shows no signs of wear, and the cards and cash are
   held tightly in the three different pockets (in addition to the
   driver license pocket) so they don't fall out. It's probably my
   favorite wallet, and the least expensive.

   One of the pockets is advertised as RFID-blocking. I haven't
   tested it, nor am I concerned about it.

   stew in maybe 10 minutes from scratch for lunch or dinner.
   Brisket, ribs, a whole chicken, whatever: total prep and
   cooking time for each under 30 minutes. Paleo bone broth in an
   hour or less. Experiment with molecular gastronomy techniques,
   rev up your Maillard reaction. Cook perfect rice. It's
   fantastic for travel or hot weather cooking, perhaps a student

   kitchen, or have a kitchen at all).

   [201]Magnetic phone mount[202] [mount-12.jpg?w=970] I started
   using a magnetic phone mount for my car over a year ago, and I
   think it is the best way to secure my phone to the dashboard.
   I've tried lots of other kinds of mounts, and this is the most
   convenient. The only downside is that you have to apply a thin
   metal plate to the back of your phone or phone case so it will
   stick to the the magnet on the mount. But the plate is very
   thin and it's not a bother.


   The magnetic mount attaches to an air vent on your car. This
   could be another downside, but since I live in Los Angeles, I'm
   almost always running the air conditioning so it keeps my phone
   from overheating when the sun is on it. That makes the air vent
   mount an upside for me. (With other mounts, the phone would get
   so hot that the safety shutdown would sometimes activate to
   prevent damage to the phone.)

   [205]Vintage Teasmade and Alarm Clock[206]

   alarm-clocks (which automatically brew a cup of tea using an

   late-original models -- I'm sure I saw one that looked
   practically identical at the Victoria and Albert Museum -- and
   designed it for bedside use, so you don't even have to stagger
   into the kitchen to get your first readymade cup.

   [197030_197030_1-12.jpg?w=970] As someone who wears glasses --
   and not contacts -- there always comes a point at which I have
   to choose between being able to see and being warm. Whether
   it's having my nose/cheeks covered with my scarf (which blows
   my breath up over my goggles) or having my hat low over my
   forehead (which blocks the vents), I end up being miserable and
   half-blind. It's not just uncomfortable, either -- it's
   dangerous. Skiing without being able to see isn't a thrill,
   it's a terror.


   I've tried every conceivable anti-fog solution, from waxes to
   sprays to special coatings to cloths, and none of them can deal
   with the brutal reality of subzero temperatures and my warm,
   foggy breath.

   Finally, this year, I broke down and bought goggles with the
   dumbest-imaginable gimmick: a little fan built into them.

   It actually worked. Really, really worked. The fan, which you
   turn on before you leave for the day and turn off when you get
   back, and which has a "turbo" mode for bad fog -- runs on a
   pair of AAA batteries that lasted for eight full days of skiing
   without flagging.

   Alexander and Dr. Cornel West's book directly challenged the

     With dazzling candor, legal scholar Michelle Alexander
     argues that "we have not ended racial caste in America; we
     have merely redesigned it." By targeting black men through
     the War on Drugs and decimating communities of color, the
     U.S. criminal justice system functions as a contemporary
     system of racial control—relegating millions to a permanent
     second-class status—even as it formally adheres to the
     principle of colorblindness.

   [1654x2551sr1-2.jpg?w=970] "Radical ecology" has come to mean a
   kind of left-wing back-to-the-landism that throws off consumer
   culture and mass production for a pastoral low-tech lifestyle.
   But as the brilliant science journalist and Marxist Leigh
   Phillips writes in Austerity Ecology & the Collapse-Porn
   Addicts: A Defence Of Growth, Progress, Industry And Stuff, if
   the left has a future, it has to reclaim its Promethean
   commitment to elevating every human being to a condition of
   luxurious, material abundance and leisure through technological
   progress.


   Phillips is a brilliant writer and an incisive scientific
   thinker with impeccable credentials in the science press. He's
   also an unapologetic Marxist. In this book -- which is one of
   the most entertaining and furious reads about politics and
   climate you're likely to read -- he rails against the
   "austerity ecology" movement that calls for more
   labor-intensive processes, an end to the drive to increase
   material production, and a "simpler" life that often contains
   demands for authoritarian, technocratic rule, massive
   depopulation, and a return to medieval drudgery.

   It wasn't always thus. The left -- especially Marxist left --
   has a long history of glorifying technological progress and
   proposing it as the solution to humanity's woes. Rather than
   blaming the machine for pollution, Marxists blame capitalism
   for being a system that demands that firms pollute to whatever
   extent they can, right up the point where the fines outweigh
   the savings.

   would tell me that BASIC was not a real programming language.


   I never learned any other languages, but recently I've started

   novel -- a fresh look at science fiction's most cherished
   memes, ruthlessly shredded and lovingly reassembled.


   It's odd to call Charlie Jane Anders, editor of IO9 and
   celebrated short-story writer and editor a "debut novelist,"
   but All the Birds in the Sky is her first science fiction novel
   for adults, and it embodies all that's best about debut novels
   -- a lifetime's worth of creativity, frustrations and
   inspirations crammed into a single set of covers, bursting with
   wild promise.

   Patricia is a witch. One day while hiding out in the woods from
   her dysfunctional family -- psychotic sister, dead-eyed
   overachiever parents -- she discovers that she can speak to
   animals, and finds herself in the presence of the Parliament of
   Birds, who ask her a riddle. She blacks out and awakens in her
   family house and facing punishment.

   Laurence is a geek. He has successfully managed many of the
   serious challenges to attaining full geekdom -- building his
   own GNU/Linux box and successfully decoding the notoriously
   cryptic instructions for building a two-second time-machine,
   you know, one of those watches that makes you jump two seconds
   into the future? He is the goat of his school and a perennial
   disappointment to his violently normal parents.

   Of course they become friends, and enemies. At their awful
   school, both are targeted for vicious bullying, and they try to
   have each other's backs, though they can't, exactly. Especially
   Laurence, who's a bit of a dick. It doesn't help that the
   school guidance counsellor is a psychotic assassin who's had a
   vision of Patricia and Laurence growing up to destroy the human
   race, and who is doing his best to kill them both, though the
   assassin's guild rules prohibit him personally slipping in the
   knife.

   great alternative to genre fantasy and its grim 'n' gritty

   [347]'Unhappenings' is a fantastic time travel novel[348]
   [51kG2dsp-PL._SX322_BO1204203200_-2.jpg?w=970] Edward Aubry's
   Unhappenings is a smart and satisfying time travel novel. I
   love stories about paradox created by folks moving around in
   time, and this novel has it in spades. At age 14 Nigel Walden
   starts to experience the titular Unhappenings, mundane things
   in his life seem to random change. The color of his bicycle
   changes, and conversations he thought he had never occurred,
   but then his first girlfriend disappears as if she never
   existed. Every time Nigel gets close to someone, he seemingly
   causes a catastrophe that leaves the relationship never having
   happened. As he reaches college, Nigel realizes he must be
   involved in some sort of time travel. Things only get more
   complicated. Aubry's writing is clear, simple and telling. I
   felt Nigel's emotional traumas and the difficulty of growing up
   so different, the slower pace of this novel is well employed.

   [351]Flying Saucers are Real![352]
   [BH-180-UFO-WEBSLIDES-004-1-2.jpg?w=970]


   Jack Womack is an accomplished science fiction writer and part
   of the first wave of cyberpunks; he's also one of the world's
   foremost collectors of flying saucer ephemera: the zines, cheap
   paperbacks, and esoteric material associated with the
   saucer-craze, a virtually forgotten, decades-long global mania
   that features livestock mutilations, abductions, messages of
   intergalactic brotherhood, claims of both divine and satanic
   origins, and psychic phenomena.

   Womack's collection has found a permanent home at Georgetown
   University's library, and Womack has lovingly curated a
   spectacular, 283-page anthology of the most fascinating
   material from the collection, accompanied by his notes and an
   introduction by William Gibson, whose own mother once saw a
   saucer.

   Flying saucers are like hot sauce: whatever you love best, you
   might love it better with a few dashes of saucers. Womack's
   thematically organized collection traces how saucers worked
   their way into Christianity, Satanic panics, Red scares, belief
   in psi powers, military conspiracy theories, hollow Earth
   conspiracies, New Age reboots of Tibetan mysticism,
   conspiracies about Nazis (and Hitler), and, of course, radical,
   unhinged theories about Elvis Presley.

   Womack presents his material with bone-dry wit -- if you've
   ever heard him speak, I guarantee you'll be able to hear his
   urbane, deadpan delivery in every sentence. He's not exactly
   making fun of his subjects. Oh, OK, sometimes he is, but just
   the most naked of hucksters and scammers -- but when it comes
   to the true believers, Womack has a mix of compassion and
   wonder at their ability to believe what they believe -- and
   convince others of their beliefs.

   [355]The Official ScratchJr Book[356] [scratchjr-2.jpg?w=970]
   You're probably familiar with Scratch, the introductory
   programming language that allows kids (and adults) to create
   interactive stories, games, and animations. Scratch doesn't
   require lines of code to write programs. Instead, you build
   programs by snapping together colored blocks. (My book, Maker
   Dad, has an introduction to Scratch that shows how to make
   retro-style video games).


   Scratch is perfect for kids 8 and up. Recently, MIT Media Lab's
   Lifelong Kindergarten Lab announced the release of ScratchJr,
   an even simpler programming language for young children (ages
   5-7) to create interactive stories and games. It's free and
   runs on iPads and Android tablets. Mitchel Resnick, who runs
   MIT Media Lab's Lifelong Kindergarten Lab, and Marina Umaschi
   Bers, a professor in the Computer Science Department at Tufts
   University, have a new book out called, The Official ScratchJr
   Book: Help Your Kids Learn to Code. The publisher sent me a
   copy, and it looks like a great way for parents to learn about
   ScratchJr so they can get their kids up to speed and let them
   go off on their own. With full color screenshots on every page,
   it provides a thorough overview of everything ScratchJr is
   capable of doing. [357]More

   [368]Mary and Vincent Price's incredible recipe book[369]
   [IMG_0482-e1422981124381-2.jpg?w=970] Wandering through a used
   book store yesterday, I came across a book with an unremarkable
   title: A Treasury of Great Recipes. Normally this would not
   catch my attention, but the book's co-authors were Vincent and
   Mary Price. I had no idea that the horror film star and his
   wife were so amazing! In addition to both being world famous
   for their careers, thespian and costume designer respectively,
   they were also world travelers, collectors of art, and
   evidently lovers of fine food. Vincent and Mary are said to
   have begged, flattered and connived to acquire their favorite
   recipes from the the world's most famous restaurants. This book
   is as much an adventure as it is a collection of recipes.
   Vincent and Mary. Published in 1965, it contains personal
   stories from Vincent and Mary, and descriptions of the
   restaurants. It is also full of photographs of the couple and
   their friends enjoying the restaurants, reprints of the
   restaurant's menus, and a most importantly, a collection of
   recipes that Vincent and Mary used to recreate the dishes at
   home, for their guests. The written descriptions of each item
   show you just how awesome this couple was. Try this description
   of New England Clam Chowder, from Boston's famous Locke-Ober's:
   This is the true, the authentic clam chowder invented and
   relished by seagoing New Englanders, and a favorite there for
   generations. There is something called Manhattan Clam Chowder
   made with tomatoes and therefore a ruddy color, but your proper
   Bostonian will have nothing to do with that aberrant form.
   Locke-Ober's recipe is for the pale cream-colored soup to which
   you may add a dusting of paprika for color, no more. As far as
   flavor is concerned, it doesn't even need that. The voice
   throughout is direct, refined, and clearly reflects their
   passion for the subject at hand. This amazing collection is
   filled with gems: Breakfasts from the Super Chief, dinners from
   Rivoli in Mexico City, and fantastic German fare from Lüchow's
   in New York are but a few of the locations that grabbed my
   interest. I have big plans for this tome. I'm going to start
   having friends over for a series of Vincent and Mary Price
   meals. This Friday may include clam chowder. The cream-colored
   variety, of course. I found this book at my local used
   bookstore in wonderful shape for $35. Clearly the Amazon
   vendors want more. But it's worth acquiring, however you go
   about it, and whatever price you pay.

   [372]Weapons of Math Destruction[373]
   [81l6jPC02BjL-1-2.jpg?w=970]


   Discussions about big data's role in our society tends to focus
   on algorithms, but the algorithms for handling giant data sets
   are all well understood and work well. The real issue isn't
   algorithms, it's models. Models are what you get when you feed
   data to an algorithm and ask it to make predictions. As O'Neil
   puts it, "Models are opinions embedded in mathematics."

   O'Neil calls these harmful models "Weapons of Math
   Destruction," and not all fault models qualify. For a model to
   be a WMD, it must be opaque to its subjects, harmful to their
   interests, and grow exponentially to run at huge scale.

   These WMDs are now everywhere. The sleazy for-profit
   educational system has figured out how to use models to
   identify desperate people and sucker them into signing up for
   expensive, useless "educations" that are paid for with punitive
   student loans, backed by the federal government. That's how the
   University of Phoenix can be so profitable, even after spending
   upwards of $1B/year on marketing. They've built a WMD that
   brings students in at a steady clip despite the fact that they
   spend $2,225/student in marketing and only $892/student on
   instruction. Meanwhile, the high-efficacy, low-cost community
   colleges are all but invisible in the glare and roar of the
   University of Phoenix's marketing blitzkreig.

   [380]Too Like the Lightning (Terra Ignota)[381]
   [81Cb-BHri6L-2-2.jpg?w=970] Ada Palmer's 25th century is in the
   midst of a long and carefully maintained peace, a peace that
   came only after the Church Wars, when religion nearly destroyed
   the world. Religions have been abolished, no grouping of more
   than three people may discuss religious subjects. The advent of
   ballistic, supersonic flying cars have eliminated space as a
   constraint on human grouping, all but abolishing nation-states
   in the process.


   Humans belong to post-geographic affinity groups, some very
   large (Humanists, Utopians, Mitsubishi, Masons, and more),
   others much finer-grained: fans of a given sports-team,
   adherents to a philosophy, members of a trade guild or a
   hobbyist association. Every person is a minority of one, and
   majority has been abolished, taking with it the oppression of
   the many over the few. Even gender has ceased to be a
   meaningful category, though certain perverts insist on the use
   of gendered pronouns to describe themselves. Families are gone,
   replaced by group houses called bash'es, where child-rearing
   and other familial functions are shared by many adults and
   their children. Also all but gone is the penal system: instead
   of sending those who steal and murder to prison, they are
   turned into work-servants, "Servicers," whom any person may
   command, and who may only eat food given to them in return for
   their service.

   Mycroft Canner, the book's protagonist and narrator, is one
   such criminal -- in fact, as we learn, he is a contender for
   the most notorious criminal of his age, whose brilliance and
   savagery has made him the confidant of every leader of every
   strat, and a trusted helper for the most important bash', the
   elite family who manage the flying cars whose smooth running is
   critical to the literal survival of 25th century society.

   Palmer writes science fiction like a historian, maneuvering
   vast historical forces deftly, plunging effortlessly into their
   minutae and detail, zooming out to dizzying heights to show how
   they all fit together. Her acknowledgements cite Alfred Bester
   as an influence, and that's no surprise -- few writers can
   trump Bester for the sense of a world that contains within it
   all the other worlds of all its inhabitants. Palmer, though,
   may have exceeded the master.

   [392]Everything Belongs to the Future[393]
   [Everything-BelongsFINAL-2.jpg?w=970]


   Penny's story -- a novella from the Tor.com imprint -- is set
   in the last years of the 21st century, just as the very first
   ageless immortals are approaching their centenary. They are the
   beneficiaries of a drug that halts aging, a $100/day pill that
   you need to take every day -- a pill that revolutionizes the
   relationship of wealthy elites to the world. Once it's clear
   that the rich can live forever, patent law is immediately
   amended to provide for eternal royalties to the pharma company
   behind the drug, and climate change is suddenly a deadly
   serious business, with no expense spared for remediation.
   Inheritance laws and the relationship of rich children to their
   parents become very different indeed, and then there's the rest
   of us.

   What if you don't have $400K/year to spare on anti-aging meds?
   Well, you could apply for a grant. The smartest scientists, the
   most successful artists, the people who amuse and assist the
   hyper-wealthy are all eligible for permanent, endless, lifetime
   supplies of the drugs. If you don't fit the bill, well, it's a
   meritocracy, isn't it? Try and raise some kids who amuse and
   entertain the super-wealthy and maybe they'll bud off a new
   immortal line. Follow your dreams, kids!

   Penny's protagonists are a ragtag group of protesters,
   anarcho-syndicalist crustypunks who steal anti-aging meds from
   the rich students and dons of Oxford University and hand them
   out for free in the slums where the caretakers and janitors and
   waiters and sex-workers live. Unbeknownst to these resistors,
   one of their number is actually a police undercover agent, a
   snitch who's much older than he seems -- thanks to the
   anti-aging meds he receives as part of his compensation -- and
   who is sexually involved with one of them, besotted with her,
   planning to take her with him into a life everafter just before
   the police sweep in an take the rest of them into custody.

   Everyday Life[413]
   [51dpHV72BELL._SX350_BO1204203200_-2.jpg?w=970] In his
   introduction, Droit says the purpose of the experiments is to
   "provoke tiny moments of awareness," and to "shake a certainty
   we had taken for granted: our own identity, say, or the
   stability of the outside world, or even the meanings of words."
   Most of the experiments require about 20 minutes to complete,
   and often involve nothing more than merely thinking about
   something.


   Some of the experiments you'll probably want to try when you
   are alone at home (like calling your name repeatedly for 20
   minutes, or repeating some other word to drain it of its
   meaning), but others can be performed anywhere (like imagining
   that the world was "created from nothing, just an instant ago"
   and will vanish "like a light going out" in 20 minutes). Some
   of the experiments you can't really plan in advance; they'll
   happen by accident, like when you wake up without knowing where
   you are -- a magical experience I love having, but Droit
   explains how to make the best use of this five-second-long
   "delicious lightness of a mystery without menace" the next time
   it happens: "What you do not know, for a tiny interval of time,
   is what the place is called, where it is, and you you are doing
   there.

   But you're certain that you are somewhere, and will find out
   very soon... try not to lose hold of this rare moment of
   perfect suspension between doubt and confidence, certitude and
   ignorance, anxiety and satisfaction." One of the things I've
   learned from doing just a few of the exercises in this book is
   how hard it to stop being so busy and slow down enough to do
   the experiments. I don't want to stop sitting in front of my
   computer, playing games, reading a book, tending to chickens,
   tidying the house, or a million other things that tug at me,
   but a few minutes after getting started with one of Droit's
   exercises, I feel good about taking a break from those habitual
   behaviors. [414]BUY [415]SHARE

   [437]The Turnip Princess and Other Newly Discovered Fairy
   Tales[438] [512HDjdNrBL._SX324_BO1204203200_-2.jpg?w=970]
   Written by Franz Xaver von Schonwerth in the 19th century and
   edited by Erika Eichenseer in the 21st century, this body of
   fairy tales surfaced only recently and can be encounted free of
   the Hollywood trappings that have long veiled more familiar
   folk stories. Fascinating, florid and "grimmer than Grimm,"
   this book is a thoroughly Germanic fantasy landscape and far
   more entertaining than you probably expect it to be.

   [441]Lovecraft Country: A Novel[442]
   [lccountrycov1-2.jpg?w=970] HP Lovecraft, father of the Cthulhu
   mythos, was, even by the disgusting standard of his day, a
   scumbag racist pig. Seriously. Even Robert Howard couldn't let
   Lovecraft's vicious invective pass without comment. David
   Nickle's novel Eutopia pulled down Lovecraft's pants and showed
   us all his shame.


   Lovecraft Country doesn't stop at the clothing.

   The novel involves a large, extended, accomplished
   African-American family living in Jim Crow Chicago. These
   characters -- a young soldier, a radical printer, a grifter's
   daughter turned landlady, a travel agent, a budding comics
   creator, and many others -- don't need Elder Gods to experience
   horror. They live it in their daily lives, through harassment,
   violence, expropriation, and the legacy of slavery that is
   anything but ancient history for them.

   Each character gets their own novella, a series of linked tales
   that both illustrates, at a visceral level, the terrors of the
   black American experience, and the family's relationship to
   another family, former enslavers who are Lovecraftian
   sorcerers, obsessed with the taming of ancient mysteries and
   sacrifices to unknowable Elder Gods from beyond our universe.

   [445]Z Burbia, a novel by Jake Bible[446]
   [81-5G46N-WL-2.jpg?w=970] The first novel in Jake Bible's
   series Z Burbia hooked me. What appeared to be a jokey take on
   zombie fiction quickly develops some great characters and
   story. Jason "Long Pork" Stanford and his family live in a
   small community outside Asheville, NC. They've used the local
   geography and their HOA to secure the housing complex and have
   spent several years keeping things together. Their insular
   policies and strict adherence to the CC&Rs of Whispering Pines,
   their home, have kept them alive in the face of bandits,
   cannibals and of course hordes of zombies. Sadly, things are
   about to fall apart. I've enjoyed the characters, Bible has an
   ability to write little about folks, while not having them be
   cartoons. The plot, once you get past the condo association
   stuff, is rather standard Zombie fare, but I'm very much
   looking forward to the rest of his series. I got the first and
   second books via Kindle Unlimited.

   and fanatical as his world dies--a death not entirely the fault
   of French-speaking invaders. Written in an argot based on early
   English, it's alien yet close to home, a brew of English
   resentment, futility and self-destruction that tells us history
   is often prophecy. What better year to enjoy it again than
   2016.

   [469]Displacement[470] [displacement-n7-2.jpg?w=970] I'm pretty
   bad at keeping up with new cartoonists. I'm stuck in the world
   of artists who emerged in the 80s and 90s: Daniel Clowes, Mary
   Fleener, Julie Doucet, Carol Tyler, Lynda Barry, Los Bros
   Hernandez, Jim Woodring, Roberta Gregory, Peter Bagge, Chris
   Ware, Dori Seda. Lucy Knisley is one of the rare younger
   cartoonists that I've gotten hooked on. (I interviewed Lucy on
   my podcast Gweek in 2013.)


   I'm a fan of the "ligne claire" drawing style, which Lucy
   exemplifies, and her sense of page composition is clean but
   with the perfect whimsical touch. She also colors her drawings
   with watercolors, not Photoshop, so they have a nice texture.
   Her work is mostly autobiographical. Her 2008 book, French
   Milk, is an illustrated journal about living (and eating) in
   Paris with her mother. Her next book, Relish, is about growing
   up in the food industry. In 2015 she wrote Displacement, a
   comic book travelogue about taking her frail grandparents on an
   ocean cruise. Lucy does not have children, and was not familiar
   with taking care of dependent people, so she was stunned by how
   exhausting the "vacation" was. Her 91-year-old grandmother had
   dementia and didn't really know who Lucy was, and her
   93-year-old grandfather had an incontinence problem that he
   didn't care about.

   Lucy ended up having to wash his trousers every evening when
   she was able to convince him to take them off. In between the
   diary entries about things like waiting in line for 3 hours to
   board the ship, calling her father asking for help (he wasn't
   helpful), and putting up with the bossy ship's crew, Lucy
   included excerpts from her grandfather's WWII journal, which
   shows him to be an excellent, observant writer, much like Lucy
   herself. I felt sorry for Lucy because the trip was stressful
   and exhausting. She had to deal with vomit, soiled clothing,
   and lost grandparents on a daily basis. But she had a great
   sense of humor about her ordeal and her patient and sympathetic
   care for her grandparents was touching. Lucy entered a new
   level of adulthood on this trip, and her story of how is
   happened is fascinating.

   [473]Parent Hacks: 134 Genius Shortcuts for Life with Kids[474]
   [9780761189060-1-2.jpg?w=970]


   We've been linking to Asha Dornfest's amazing Parent Hacks blog
   for more than a decade, and we loved her 2013 Minmalist
   Parenting. Dornfest's strength is her ability to choose "hacks"
   that are simultaneously useful and simple, a welcome contrast
   from the Martha Stewart-ish norm, which amounts to, "Given an
   entire free afternoon, here's something you can do to impress
   your friends (maybe)."

   As you'll see from the samples below, Dornfest's picked out the
   best of these from her deep drawersful of great ideas,
   thematically grouping them for parenting's greatest daily
   challenges: pregnancy, sleeping, eating, bath time, travel,
   etc. At least one of them comes from me: using panty-liners
   (which airplanes and trains have spares of in the bathroom) to
   extend the life of a diaper (which you can't replenish
   in-flight!) when you're caught short.

   With friendly, subject-sorted tips that can be used for easy
   reference, this is the perfect kind of parenting book: one you
   don't need to read from cover-to-cover while you're juggling
   your kid(s), but which you can turn to whenever you're in need.

   [501]Every Heart a Doorway[502]
   [Every2BHeart2Ba2BDoorway-1-2.jpg?w=970] Eleanor West's Home
   for Wayward Children is a boarding school for children --
   almost all girls -- who've gone through a mysterious doorway
   and found themselves in some fantasy world: wicked worlds,
   playful worlds, nonsense worlds, brilliant worlds. These
   adventures these children lived in their worlds changed them
   forever, as years passed in the other realms and they grew to
   be people they'd never imagined being before they passed
   through the door.


   And then, for reasons most of them will never understand, they
   were sent back to the world they'd come from. Our world. For
   their parents, they'd been gone for months, or maybe a few
   years in some extreme cases, and all those parents assume that
   their children were kidnapped, or ran away, or faced some
   terrible privation, and that's the reason they're full of
   obviously impossible tales of these other worlds. That's the
   reason they're so inconsolably, cripplingly sad to have been
   exiled from the realm of magic.

   Eleanor West tells the parents that this is a rare but not
   unheard-of mental illness among girls on the verge of
   womanhood, and offers to treat their children at her rural
   boarding school, a Hogwarts for faerie's refugees. But Eleanor
   West is herself one of those girls who went to faerie, a High
   Nonsense realm whose door is open to her now, though she
   herself is too infected by our world's logic to survive there
   any longer. She operates the school as a kindness and a
   mission, to comfort her fellow refugees and offer them coping
   skills and the pooled knowledge of all those who've walked to
   other worlds (including those rare, lucky few who've been able
   to go back to their adopted homes after their exile in our
   reality).

   Nancy has newly come to the school, from a "High Logic" world,
   an underworld kingdom where she served the lord of death, first
   as a statue who held so still that she could live on a few sips
   of pomegranate juice, then as an important courtier. Her lord
   has sent her back to reality so she can assure herself that she
   would freely choose the world of the dead forever, but now that
   she's here, she can't find the way back.

   [509]Arcology: The City in the Image of Man[510]
   [17110468451_9540e0ed6b_h1-2.jpg?w=970] Soleri taught
   architecture at ASU, but his real classroom was Arcosanti: "an
   experimental town and molten bronze bell casting community" a
   few hours from Phoenix, which was supposed to have 5,000
   residents by now, demonstrating "lean" city living in
   high-density complexes that combined super-efficient usage of
   space with stylized, naturalistic exteriors that made each
   building part of the landscape.


   Soleri was a crank, a visionary, a mystic and a doomsayer. His
   arcologies -- "architecture" plus "ecology" -- were meant to
   head off the coming population bomb, which, combined with urban
   sprawl, would destroy the planet. Soleri conceived of a city as
   dense as Tokyo or New York, but with a pastoral sensibility
   that kept each of his titanic towers in synch with nature.

   If this sounds familiar, it's because Soleri's ideas were far
   more successful with futurists than they were with the actual
   future. Arcologies appeared as staples of science fiction
   cover-art, and their descendants can be contemporary sf,
   including the great, interplanetary hollow asteroid craft
   plying the spacelanes in Kim Stanley Robinson's brilliant 2312.
   I think there was an arcology in ever single issue of OMNI.
   Judge Dredd's Mega City One was dense with towering arcologies.
   The victory condition in Sim City 2000? Your highrises turn
   into arcologies.

   Soleri's arcologies are all in cutaway form, like a full-page
   Fantastic Four clubhouse diagram by Jack Kirby, ferociously
   detailed and aching with unfulfilled desire. Soleri wants these
   things to exist, and he uses his pen to show us how fucking
   cool it would be to live in the cities of his mind. Every one
   of these diagrams should be a poster.

   [517]My Life as a White Trash Zombie[518] [wtz-2.jpg?w=970] In
   My Life as a White Trash Zombie, by Diana Rowland, Angel
   Crawford wakes up in the hospital with no memory of what
   happened the night before. The nurse tells her that she'd been
   found passed out and naked on the side of the road.


   Angel is not surprised. She’s a beer-drinking, pill-popping,
   teenage delinquent with a rap sheet and a reputation for
   causing trouble. Passing out from booze and drugs isn’t
   anything new. She is surprised, however, by a package that’s
   been left for her in the hospital by a mysterious stranger. It
   includes a note telling her that she has a job waiting for her
   at the county morgue, and a few glass beverage bottles of
   odd-looking liquid. The note instructs her to drink a bottle
   every other day and report to work the next day, with a warning
   that if she doesn’t, the consequences will be dire.

   She has no idea who gave her the note and bottles, but she
   reluctantly heeds the stranger’s instructions. Her new job
   entails driving bodies to the morgue and helping the coroner
   open up the bodies to determine the cause of death. It’s around
   this time that Angel discovers, much to her self-disgust, that
   she is tremendously hungry for the cadavers’ brains. In the
   days that follow, she learns that she is a zombie. Eventually,
   she meets up with other zombies, both good and bad, and tries
   to learn how she became a zombie, tries to keep herself
   well-fed with brains without actually killing anyone, tries to
   avoid getting beat-up by her alcoholic father, tries to rid
   herself of her heartless boyfriend, and tries to avoid getting
   decapitated by an unknown zombie hunter who has been picking
   off the town’s ghouls, one-by-one.

   Zombies operate differently in Rowland’s universe. If they have
   eaten enough brains, they are indistinguishable from ordinary
   people. But when they go too long without feeding, they start
   to smell like rotting flesh, their appendages fall off, and
   they lose higher order brain functions. They become George
   Romero style zombies. Eating brains will return their
   personalities and regenerate their missing fingers and toes. My
   Life as a White Trash Zombie is lighter fare than most zombie
   books and movies I’ve consumed, but I thoroughly enjoyed
   following Angel around as she learned to handle old and new
   challenges. It was published in 2001, and since then, Rowland
   has written three other White Trash Zombies books, all
   highly-rated on Amazon.

     everything today's reader wants in a good story. Sex (lots
     of it, including adultery, sodomy, incest), also murder,
     war, massacres, and so on... But as I kept on reading, I
     realized that this is actually an anthology, involving
     several writers, with many--too many--stretches of poetry,
     and passages that are downright mawkish and boring, and
     jeremiads that make no sense. The end result is a monster
     omnibus. It seems to have something for everybody, but ends

   understand what Makey Makey is by [539]watching this video of
   it in action than by describing it, but I’ll give it a shot.
   Makey Makey is a printed circuit board that you connect to any
   computer with a USB cable (included). You don’t need to install
   any software. Your computer thinks Makey Makey is a keyboard.
   And it is a keyboard of sorts. But it doesn’t use standard
   keys. Instead, you connect wires from Makey Makey to anything
   that conducts electricity: a piece of fruit, a bowl of water, a
   cup of soup, a scrap of aluminum foil, blobs of Play-Doh. When
   you touch the object with your finger, your computer will think
   you are pressing a key on a standard keyboard. You can assign
   the object to be a spacebar key, an arrow key, or a letter key.
   And you can connect several objects to Makey Makey at the same
   time, so that you can create game controllers, musical
   interfaces, and other button-controlled devices.


   It might not sound like much fun, but the possibilities are
   endless, and Makey Makey’s ease of use encourages
   quick-and-dirty experimentation. My 12-year-old was instantly
   transfixed by Makey Makey and she started making all sorts of
   things with it, including a drum machine triggered by apple
   slices, and a game controller out of a cardboard box and bits
   of foil.

   Makey Makey also works with Scratch, the excellent kids’
   software development platform. Check out the [540]Makey Makey
   games people have created using Scratch.

   [617]Copper mugs for Moscow Mules[618] [mule-mugs-7.jpg?w=970]
   I didn't know what a Moscow Mule was until I saw the Bali Hai
   episode of Better Call Saul. The drink, made from vodka, ginger
   beer, and lime juice, poured over ice, was served to Kim Wexler
   (my favorite character on the show, played by Rhea Seehorn) in
   a copper mug. Recently, I went on vacation with my wife, and
   she ordered a Moscow Mule at a restaurant. It was served in a
   copper mug. It turns out you are supposed to serve them that
   way.


   The origins of the Moscow Mule are a bit murky, but it appears
   to have been invented in the early 1940s by the owner of a
   Hollywood pub on the Sunset Strip called the Cock 'n' Bull. The
   bartender wanted to clean out a slow-moving stockpile of
   Smirnoff's and bottled ginger beer that had been gathering dust
   on the shelves in the backroom, so he mixed them together and
   started serving them in copper mugs to the movie stars who
   frequented the pub. It became an instant hit, at least until
   McCarthyism scared people away from anything with the taint of
   Sovietism to it. But the Moscow Mule had a kick that people
   liked, and it made a comeback in the 1960s, which it enjoys
   today.

   [687]Crossbow pistol[688]
   [tumblr_nshorbugmn1u9pcmwo1_1280-7.jpg?w=970] I bought this
   crossbow pistol because my family’s favorite character on The
   Walking Dead, Daryl Dixon, uses a crossbow to take out zombies,
   and we thought it would be fun for target practice. It was only
   about $25, and I didn’t expect it to be very powerful, but I
   was wrong. A bolt shot from this thing could kill someone. It
   easily penetrates plywood. I’m not sure if a bolt could go
   through someone’s skull, but it would definitely lodge itself
   in a leg, arm, abdomen, or neck.


   If you buy this, give it the same respect you would a firearm.
   It’s not a toy, but it sure is fun. That said, I don't think
   anyone under the age of 18 should use it without adult
   supervision.

   It doesn’t require a lot of effort to cock it, but a smaller
   kid would not be able to figure out how to do it. The safety
   automatically engages when you cock it, thankfully. The
   crossbow comes with three aluminum (very sharp) bolts. You can
