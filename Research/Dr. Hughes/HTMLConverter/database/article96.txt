   Daniele Struppa is a mountain climber, a professor who explores
   Renaissance paintings and a father who talks to his 12-year-old
   about antibiotics and atoms.

   And on Friday, Chapman University will officially welcome the
   mathematician as its 13th president.

   Struppa said he will challenge himself to “create a place where
   marvel and wonder is sustained. I think it’s so special to find
   engaged learners who have the ability to keep asking questions.
   Look into the mind of a child — it’s a beautiful thing.”

   A former Chapman chancellor and provost, Struppa’s ascension
   coincides with the school’s jump to No. 6 in its regional
   category in the 2017 edition of “America’s Best Colleges”
   published by U.S. News & World Report.

   Outgoing President James Doti said that two and a half years
   ago, when he decided he would retire at 70, he suggested to the
   Board of Trustees that Struppa, 61, should be his successor.
   They eventually took  the idea to the faculty for a vote.

   “So many colleges and universities bring in an outsider when
   they don’t know if that person really understands the culture
   and ethos. They take a big risk,” Doti said. “But when you
   promote an internal candidate, it’s saying that you respect
   those inside your organization — that you’re building an
   environment where people can move forward.”

   He said he likes Struppa’s sense of humor, his candor and the
   fact that he continues to teach while juggling so many
   responsibilities.

   Struppa, born in Milan of Sicilian ancestry, is a graduate of
   the University of Milan and later earned his doctorate at the
   University of Maryland in College Park. He has four children,
   ages 9 to 31. A prolific author, he’s written a book on
   fundraising and scaled mountains in Europe, Africa and South
   America.

   He describes mathematics as “not something just for a few
   nerds. It has depth.”

   Struppa said that in the last few years Chapman has made
   strides in the study of health sciences, with a separate campus
   in Irvine that houses the university’s School of Pharmacy, a
   doctoral program in physical therapy and a physician’s
   assistant program. The university is constructing a
   $130-million science building on the northeast side of the main
   Orange campus, which at 140,000 square feet would make it the
   largest structure at Chapman.

   Doti credits Struppa with recruiting Vernon L. Smith, a Nobel
   laureate in economics, to Chapman along with Yakir Aharonov, a
   National Medal of Science winner in physics.

   “We’ve gone from a small liberal arts college to a
   well-recognized regional school. He can bring us to the next
   rung where we’ll be considered a significant national
   university along the same lines of a Tufts, a Tulane or a
   Vanderbilt,” Doti said.

   Annabell Liao, the student body president, said she appreciates
   Struppa’s role in launching Chapman’s Diversity Project, a
   volunteer initiative uniting students, staff, faculty,
   administrators and trustees for dialogue on equity and
   inclusion on campus.

   “It makes a big difference when you have an outlet to talk
   about these things,” said Liao, a senior majoring in creative
   producing. She said a cross-cultural center would open on the
   Chapman campus in spring.

   “When he and other leaders say they want to have a
   student-centered university, they are acting on their goals,“
   Liao said.
