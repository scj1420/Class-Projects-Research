Rubik’s cube manufacturer loses trademark battle

   After all the [40]excitement of the UK Rubik’s cube
   championships last weekend, the European Court of Justice ruled
   on Thursday that after 10-year legal battle, the trademark on
   the shape of the Rubik’s cube is not valid.


   The trademark was registered in 1999, but since the original
   design of the cube was never patented, it’s long been on shaky
   ground. The court has ruled that the shape of the cube alone is
   not enough to protect it from copying, and that a patent would
   be needed to do so. The implications are that licensed
   manufacturers of the game could now face more competition from
   cheaper overseas sellers.
