[15]What’s Wrong with This Experiment?


   By [16]Dan Meyer • December 22, 2016 • [17]21 Comments


   If you’re the sort of person who helps students learn to design
   controlled experiments, you might offer them [18]W. Stephen
   Wilson’s experiment in The Atlantic and ask for their critique.


   First, Wilson’s hypothesis:

     Wilson fears that students who depend on technology
     [calculators, specifically –dm] will fail to understand the
     importance of mathematical algorithms.

   Next, Wilson’s experiment:

     Wilson says he has some evidence for his claims. He gave his
     Calculus 3 college students a 10-question calculator-free
     arithmetic test (can you multiply 5.78 by 0.39 without
     pulling out your smartphone?) and divided the them into two
     groups: those who scored an eight or above on the test and
     those who didn’t. By the end of the course, Wilson compared
     the two groups with their performance on the final exam.
     Most students who scored in the top 25th percentile on the
     final also received an eight or above on the arithmetic
     test. Students at the bottom 25th percentile were twice as
     likely to score less than eight points on the arithmetic
     test, demonstrating much weaker computation skills when
     compared to other quartiles.

   I trust my readers will supply the answer key in the comments.

   BTW. I’m not saying there isn’t evidence that calculator use
   will inhibit a student’s understanding of mathematical
   algorithms, or that no such evidence will ever be found. I’m
   just saying this study isn’t that evidence.

   Got one!

     I think you just found me a new example for chapter 4
     (experimental design)...

   [20]Scott Farrand:

     The most clarifying thing that I can recall being told about
     testing in mathematics came from a friend in that business:
     you’ll find a positive correlation between student
     performance on almost any two math tests. So don’t get too
     excited when it happens, and beware of using evidence of
     correlation on two tests as evidence for much.
