Infinity plus one

   supermanvsbatman

   I think most of us have had this conversation. Two kids keep
   trying to one-up each other with bigger and bigger numbers,
   until one inevitably pulls out the trump number, infinity.

   The problem is, Superman here is wrong.

   Infinity plus one is totally a thing.

   To really understand infinity, we need to think about about it
   in two different ways. The first is to ask, “What is the number
   infinity?” The second is to ask, “What does it mean to have
   infinitely many?” The first we’ll answer in this post, the
   second we’ll answer next week.

   So, what is infinity?

   All of this depends on what precise definitions you choose to
   use, but the school child’s idea is still about right. What
   number occurs after all the other numbers? Well, infinity, of
   course.

   Think about it this way: two is the number after one. Three is
   the number after two, and so on. Each counting number (also
   called natural number) is followed by another. Then, we define
   a number \omega , the Greek letter omega, to be the number just
   after all of the counting numbers^[22]1. This clearly has to be
   infinity!

   But what’s the number after \omega ? Well, \omega + 1 of
   course. Then \omega +2 . And, after all of those, \omega\cdot 2
   . It goes on. You can go on for as many layers as you wish.

   \omega^\omega . Each turn of the spiral represents one power of
   \omega

   Numbers like 1, 2 or \omega are called ordinals since they
   define the order of things. You have the first thing, the
   second thing and the \omega -th thing.

   While \omega isn’t useful in a lot of places in math, it does
   provide one resolution of the famous Zeno’s paradox. (Actually,
   Zeno has [23]six surviving paradoxes, but let’s talk about the
   most famous one.) Achillles, the fastest of the Greek warriors,
   is chasing a tortoise. However, he can’t ever catch the
   tortoise. Why not?

   In order to catch the tortoise, Achilles must first reach the
   place where the tortoise began. But by the time he arrives, the
   tortoise has moved farther away. Thus, Achilles has to run to
   that spot, but, again, the tortoise has moved on. Since
   Achilles must repeatedly reach the spot where the tortoise was,
   he can never catch the tortoise.

   Now, of course this sounds silly. Many of these philosophical
   paradoxes do. Zeno tried to use this to show that all movement
   is an illusion, despite our experience to the contrary.

   But let’s talk about this using our new idea.

   Let’s say Achilles runs 10 times faster than the
   tortoise^[24]2, but starts 100 meters behind him. After
   Achilles has gone 100 meters, the tortoise is still 10 meters
   ahead. After Achilles has gone that next 10 meters (110 meters)
   total), the tortoise is yet another meter ahead. And after
   Achilles has gone that additional meter (111 meters total), the
   dang tortoise is already ahead by another tenth of a meter. And
   so on and so forth, ad nauseum.

   la tortue ?


   After 20 cycles of this, Achilles has still not caught up,
   though he is closer than the diameter of an electron.

   Achilles is still behind the tortoise, though.

   But the \omega -th cycle is, by definition, the cycle after all
   of those cycles. And since he’s getting infinitely close during
   the first finitely many cycles, at the \omega -th cycle,
   Achilles has exactly caught up to the tortoise.

   How long does it take for Achilles to catch the tortoise?

   If he is traveling at 10 m/s (Olympic sprinter pace), the first
   cycle―100 meters―takes ten seconds, the first two
   cycles―110 meters total―takes 11 seconds, while the first
   \omega cycles takes 11.1111… seconds (or 100/9, to be exact).

   And so, Achilles can quickly catch the tortoise.

   Using this idea, we’ve come up with a number representing
   infinity. We also have numbers that are after infinity. But
   while \omega +1 is after \omega , is it bigger than \omega ?
   How about \omega \cdot 2 or \omega^\omega ?

   Before you decide, listen to this story.

   The [26]Hitchhiker’s Hotel is the largest hotel in the galaxy.
   In fact, it has infinitely many rooms. One night, every room
   was filled, when an unfortunate traveler came in begging for a
   room for the night. Fortunately for her, the hotel has a policy
   for such circumstances. They called each room and told them to
   pack up and move to the room with the next higher number on it.
   Each guest did so and the hotel worker put the new guest up in
   room number one.


   When we started, we had infinitely many guests in infinitely
   many rooms. After our lucky guest came, we had one more guest
   and the same number of rooms, but each guest still had their
   own room. So they must be the same size, right?

   In the next post, I’ll talk about how to carefully tell which
   set of things is bigger, and then show that some surprisingly
   different things are the same size.

    1.  Really, to define this carefully, we need set theory. The
       ordinal zero is the empty set. The ordinal one is the set
       of the empty set, i.e., the set of the ordinal zero. The
       ordinal two is the set of the ordinals zero and one. The
       ordinal three is the set of the ordinals zero, one and two.
       This goes on infinitely. The ordinal  \omega is then
       defined to be the limit of this process over all the
       counting numbers. Following this same pattern, \omega+1 is
       union of \omega with the set \{\omega\} , i.e., the set of
       all the finite ordinals along with \omega . For more
       details, see [27]Wikipedia, that endless source of
       knowledge. [28]↩

       so Achilles is going cheetah speed! [29]↩
