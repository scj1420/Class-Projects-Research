   Carnegie Mellon University math professor Po-Shen Loh wants
   everyone with internet access to think about math as much as
   they can. His new free website Expii crowdsources math problems
   and solutions from students, teachers and math enthusiasts from
   around the globe. Expii gives users the ability to explore math
   through real-world and pop-culture problems, like which artists
   will win the most music awards, how one makes a bigger Death
   Star, and how self-driving cars can improve travel times. Loh,
   who is also the coach of the USA International Math Olympiad
   Team, heads a small Expii team in a nondescript office in
   Oakland. Users can visit at [74]www.expii.com.


   Why did you start Expii?

   I have been trying to popularize mathematics as not just a
   thing that you do in school, but something you do to really
   understand the world better, in a really practical way. We can
   use math to find some surprising insights in the real world. …
   Every week, I sit down and meditate on some topic in the real
   world and try to see if there are any surprising math insights
   there — thinking about a real thing as a mathematician, in
   contrast to just thinking about mathematical theory. Every week
   is different; this last week’s topic was about Star Wars. ...
   Another one was the American Music Awards. There was this
   question — who is winning these things? Actually, it turns out
   there is a really strong correlation between the winners and
   how many Instagram followers they have. Which is what you might
   expect, because it is fan-voting, but I myself was shocked at
   how huge that correlation was. I can almost predict who are
   going to be the top [winners]. This is what we do.

   When I was thinking about cars on the anniversary of the Model
   T Ford. I was thinking about the mathematics behind cars,
   transportation and so on, and noticed a few observations about
   self-driving vehicles and transit.

   What kind of insights did you have about self-driving cars?

   First, I want to say that I am not the first person to ever
   think of these things — I am just trying to popularize [ideas
   like these]. I have heard before that traffic is caused by
   people braking and accelerating, causing these waves of
   traffic. But there is another thing that fundamentally governs
   traffic. Take the Fort Pitt tunnel. …  Following distance is
   generally two to three seconds; this is because of
   human-reaction time. You can’t just follow [so close] because
   you can’t hit the brakes fast enough. ... This means only one
   car every two seconds can pass in each lane, or one car per
   second for the tunnel. That means the numbers of cars that can
   pass through the Fort Pitt Tunnel, no matter how fast they are
   driving or slow they are driving, is 3,600 [per hour]. That is
   real life. If your capacity of the tunnel is only 3,600 per
   hour, now you know why there is rush hour. I know that highway
   engineers know this, but now I was finally thinking about it in
   the same way.

   Now, how does this factor into self-driving cars? The
   two-second following-distance reaction time is because of
   human-reaction time. As a human, I can only see the car in
   front of me; I don’t have this omniscient view of traffic five
   miles ahead. Now, imagine a huge network of self-driving cars;
   in fact, the value of the self-driving car is in this
   swarm-like network. Now suddenly, you don’t need that
   two-second following time. You can actually pack cars closer,
   and that is the only way to overcome this. If you allow a
   shorter following distance, we can break through this barrier
   of only 3,600 cars per hour. But the extreme case of this
   [already exists]; it’s the subway train. Take New York City,
   trains come every five minutes, with 10 cars, and each car can
   fit 150 people. That’s 1,500 people every five minutes, that’s
   18,000 people an hour.

   What do you hope to accomplish with Expii?

   We are trying to help everyone in the world learn mathematics,
   where all they need is a smartphone. We are trying to deliver
   mathematics learning to the whole world for free. There are two
   ways to do this. One is to evangelize why mathematics might be
   worth doing in the first place. This is why I try to come up
   with these problems, so [users] too might want to come up with
   [mathematical] insights. The other part is to make it so you
   don’t have to pay. So [Expii] is an automatic virtual tutor,
   which lets you have a personalized road to learn mathematics.
   Ours is a learning platform where people have contributed
   towards the problems and mini-lessons, and so everyone shares
   in it together.
