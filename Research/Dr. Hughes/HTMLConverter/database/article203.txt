       Is a ‘point’ a continuous idealisation or a discrete one?
       And isn’t synthetic differential geometry fundamentally
       about continuous objects? E.g. Infinitely differential
       functions etc. JL Bell’s book on The Continuous and the
       Infinitesimal in Mathematics and Philosophy is an
       interesting read on these issues. And Lawvree of category
       theory fame actually started out as a student of continuum
       mechanics under Truesdell who regarded point particle
       mechanics as ‘degenerate’ and ‘too discrete’.

     Is a ‘point’ a continuous idealisation or a discrete one?
            Yes.
            You’re reminding me of some quotes by Einstein. In
            1916 he wrote a letter to a former student, Walter
            Dällenbach, saying:

     You have correctly grasped the drawback that the continuum
     brings. If the molecular view of matter is the correct
     (appropriate) one; i.e., if a part of the universe is to be
     represented by a finite number of moving points, then the
     continuum of the present theory contains too great a
     manifold of possibilities. I also believe that this “too
     great” is responsible for the fact that our present means of
     description miscarry with the quantum theory. The problem
     seems to me [to be] how one can formulate statements about a
     discontinuum without calling upon a continuum (space-time)
     as an aid; the latter should be banned from the theory as a
     supplementary construction not justified by the essence of
     the problem, [a construction] which corresponds to nothing
     “real.” But we still lack the mathematical structure
     unfortunately. How much have I already plagued myself in
     this way!
            This is interesting in part because it shows how much
            Einstein thought about these issues, which he never
            really wrote anything definitive about. In 1935 he
            wrote to Langevin:

     In any case one does not have the right today to maintain
     that the foundation must consist in a field theory in the
     sense of Maxwell. The other possibility, however, leads in
     my opinion to a renunciation of the time-space continuum and
     to a purely algebraic physics. Logically this is quite
     possible (the system is described by a number of integers;
     “time” is only a possible viewpoint, from which the other
     “observables” can be considered — an observable logically
     coordinated to all the others. Such a theory doesn’t have to
     be based upon the probability concept. For the present,
     however, instinct rebels against such a theory.
            These quotes are analyzed in:
            • John Stachel, The other Einstein: Einstein contra
            field theory, Science in Context 6 (1993), 275–290.
            I thank Richard Gaylord for sending me a copy of this
            paper.

                 Interesting quotes, thanks. I’ll have to have a
                 read.
                 Somewhat related – I think Schrödinger asked
                 something like ‘what is a particle that has no
                 trajectory or path?’. Which reminds me of
                 Russell’s proposed ‘at-at’ resolution of Zeno’s
                 paradox.
                 The whole ‘discrete vs continuous’ question (and
                 what that even means) remains pretty fascinating
                 even after all these years since the Greeks (and
                 whoever else)!

       This is slightly off-topic, but I was recently reminded
       that the idealised version of Newtonian physics used in a
       lot of high school physics problems suffers from some
       curious defects.
       Suppose you place a perfectly rigid plank on a perfectly
       rigid table, with a portion of the plank jutting out over
       the edge of the table. Can you describe the pressure
       exerted by the plank on the table?
       The answer is: you can’t, or at least you can’t without
       making further assumptions. If all you have to go on is the
       static balance of forces and torques, that’s not enough to
       solve the problem. You need some kind of non-rigid material
       model for the objects; for example, you can assume that the
       surface of the table is perfectly elastic (with a huge
       spring constant), so the force it exerts against the planar
       surface of the plank is piecewise linear.
       Engineers, of course, learn all about this kind of thing
       very early on, and refer to situations like this as
       “hyperstatic”. But in high school, all the problems they
       give you tend to be carefully contrived to conceal the fact
       that the toy model being used is indeterminate even in some
       very simple situations.

            Hmm, I don’t remember ever learning about this!
            (I’m at the age where cautious statements of this sort
            become advisable.)
            In this problem we have finitely many equations and
            infinitely many unknowns. But it seems the continuum
            nature of the plank is not fundamental here! Even if
            the plank met the table at a finite grid of
            points—imagine little nails poking out of the bottom
            of the plank—you couldn’t compute the force exerted by
            the table at these points: more unknowns than
            equations.
            Somehow this reminds me of two things: a bed of nails,
            and how four-legged chairs tend to be wobbly.

            Right, even a rigid thin rod with three point-like
            supports is hyperstatic! That’s why they always limit
            these kinds of problems to two supports in high school
            physics classes. It’s not surprising that professional
            engineers need to consider the way the deck of a
            real-world bridge with three supports will flex, in
            order to make it safe, but it’s a bit startling, at
            least initially, to realise that you need to consider
            something similar just to get a unique solution for
            the forces in the simplest possible toy model of this
            system.

                 Greg, now you tell me. As a team building
                 exercise ten people including me (5 standing on
                 each side) were asked to balance an 8 ft hollow
                 aluminum rod on our 20 extended horizontal index
                 fingers, maintaining contact at all times as we
                 lowered it to the ground. We were given 20
                 minutes and failed, much to our chagrin. But
                 armed with your information, I could have thrown
                 around a little hyperstatic lingo and claimed
                 that the task was theoretically impossible.
                 Except that another team managed to do it :-)

       Here’s a question that’s only tangentially related for
       now—it’ll become relevant much later in the series, but I’m
       too impatient.
       Some people like to wonder what the electron would be like
       if it were a tiny black hole described using general
       relativity, not quantum mechanics. But in fact it would not
       be a black hole, it would be a naked singularity. I’ve been
       trying to fix the Wikipedia article on this topic:
       • Wikipedia, [70]Black hole electron.
       I’ve dramatically overhauled it, and I’m pretty happy
       except for one thing. There’s a certain length scale called
       r_q associated to a charge q, which shows up in the theory
       of charged black holes. I believe that
       \displaystyle{ r_q = \sqrt{\frac{q^2 G}{4 \pi \epsilon_0
       c^4}} } This was already on Wikipedia and I think it’s
       right. But whoever calculated this got the answer
       r_q = 9.152 \times 10^{-37} \textrm{ meters} while I’m
       getting
       r_q = 1.3807 \times 10^{-36} \textrm{ meters} This is
       annoyingly close yet far!
       Just to lay my cards on the table, I’m using
       q = 1.60217 \times 10^{-19} \textrm{C} G = 6.67408 \times
       10^{-11} \textrm{N m}^2 / \textrm{kg}^2 c = 2.9979 \times
       10^8 \textrm{m/s} \epsilon_0 = 8.85419 \times 10^{-12}
       \textrm{C}^2 / \textrm{N} \textrm{m}^2
       The ratio of my answer and theirs is suspiciously close to
       1.5. This is really pissing me off.

       I agree with all your constants, and using the formula you
       provide I get the same answer as you. So if the formula is
       correct, that other answer must be wrong. I can’t really
       guess what they did differently; if you substitute a 9 for
       the 4 in the denominator, you do get pretty close to their
       answer … but that’s a weird mistake to make.

       PS: Misner, Thorne and Wheeler give your answer as the
       length in metres corresponding to the elementary charge,
       when using geometric units. So the r_q in the
       Reissner–Nordström metric is really just the charge of the
       hole in geometric units.

            This is reassuring.
            I have their book back at home in California. Here I
            have an electronic version, but I think those formulas
            are in the back flap, which I don’t have.
            I don’t know a snappy interpretation of r_q, since the
            singularity formed by a point charge with r_q much
            larger than the Schwarzschild radius will not have a
            horizon or ergosphere, but any reasonable definition
            of the ‘size’ of the blob of warped space surrounding
            a point charge of charge q should give something on
            the order of r_q.
            It’s interesting that the characteristic size r_a =
            \frac{1}{2}\hbar / m c of the ring singularity that
            arises when we include the electron’s angular momentum
            in the calculation vastly exceeds r_q, which in turn
            vastly exceeds the electron’s Schwarzschild radius.
            r_a is so much bigger than the Planck length that we
            shouldn’t need quantum gravity to understand what’s
            going on here! But it’s so close to the Compton
            wavelength that we should be able to experimentally
            rule out a ring singularity this big.

       An even less relevant puzzle, which I record just because
       I’d otherwise forget:
       Puzzle: if you convert one Planck-mass-sized black hole
       into energy each second, how many 60-watt light bulbs can
       you power?
       It’s worthwhile guessing before one calculates.

       with the real numbers. (After attending a talk by Döring, I

       15 or so pages for lack of time. Besides, since I’m no
       physicist, I’m unable to judge whether that direction is
       promising. but I’d like to know.)

            Sure, I’ve read that paper by Isham and Döring—they’re
            not that many people interested in quantum gravity and
            category theory, so we all know each other and follow
            each other’s work.
            Chris Isham was for many years famous as the
            “conscience” of quantum gravity. He’d write papers
            reviewing work on the subject and pointing out
            problems, both conceptual and technical, without ever
            making a strong push for an approach of his own. This
            sort of careful attitude was especially important when
            loop quantum gravity and string theory took off, each
            with their own enthusiasts who tended to be blind to
            their favored theory’s faults.
            For example, if you ever become deeply interested in
            the all-important [93]“problem of time” in quantum
            gravity, and want to delve into the dozens of attempts
            to solve this and why none of them have succeeded, his
            paper [94]Canonical quantum gravity and the problem of
            time is required reading.
            Or—more likely—if you ever just want an overview of
            why quantum gravity is so tough, try his paper
            [95]Structural issues in quantum gravity.
            Over the decades he leaned ever more to the position
            that we weren’t thinking radically enough. Thus it was
            not a complete shock that when Andreas Döring burst
            onto the scene with his topos-theoretic approach to
            physics, Isham became very interested in this… but it
            was a surprise to me that Isham for the first time
            advocated an approach to quantum gravity! He once told
            me something like “I really think this is it.”
            Personally I am not convinced. Topos theory is the
            beautiful, perfected modern approach to intuitionistic
            logic, showing how this logic (which drops the
            principle of excluded middle “P or not P”) arises
            naturally from sheaf theory (the mathematical theory
            of “local truth”, which lets us say where a statement
            is true). Everyone who loves deep mathematics should
            learn at least a bit of topos theory.
            However, topos theory was not designed with quantum
            logic in mind, and I don’t think it’s a sufficient
            framework for grappling with quantum theory.
            Urs Schreiber’s work using [96]cohesive ∞-topoi to
            understand `stringy’ geometry is more interesting to
            me.
            I could say a lot more about this, but instead I’ll
            just suggest that if you want to know why Isham likes
            topos theory, a better place to start is his paper
            [97]Topos methods in the foundations of physics.

            Here was my attempt to explain Isham and Döring’s work
            in [101]week257 of This Week’s Finds, written in 2007
            after a conference at Imperial College.
              _________________________________________________


            I also spoke to Andreas Döring and Chris Isham about
            their work on topos theory and quantum physics.
            Andreas Döring lives near Greenwich, while Isham lives
            across the Thames in London proper. So, I talked to
            Döring a couple times, and once we visited Isham at
            his house.
            I mainly mention this because Isham is one of the
            gurus of quantum gravity, profoundly interested in
            philosophy… so I was surprised, at the end of our
            talk, when he showed me into a room with a huge rack
            of computers hooked up to a bank of about 8 video
            monitors, and controls reminiscent of an airplane
            cockpit.
            It turned out to be his homemade flight simulator!
            He’s been a hobbyist electrical engineer for years –
            the kind of guy who loves nothing more than a
            soldering iron in his hand. He’d just gotten a big
            750-watt power supply, since he’d blown out his
            previous one.
            Anyway, he and Döring have just come out with a series
            of papers:
            14) Andreas Döring and Christopher Isham, A topos
            foundation for theories of physics: I. Formal
            languages for physics, available as
            [102]arXiv:quant-ph/0703060.
            II. Daseinisation and the liberation of quantum
            theory, available as [103]arXiv:quant-ph/0703062.
            III. The representation of physical quantities with
            arrows, available as [104]arXiv:quant-ph/0703064.
            IV. Categories of systems, available as
            [105]arXiv:quant-ph/0703066.
            Though they probably don’t think of it this way, you
            can think of their work as making precise Bohr’s ideas
            on seeing the quantum world through classical eyes.
            Instead of talking about all observables at once, they
            consider collections of observables that you can
            measure simultaneously without the uncertainty
            principle kicking in. These collections are called
            "commutative subalgebras".
            You can think of a commutative subalgebra as a
            classical snapshot of the full quantum reality. Each
            snapshot only shows part of the reality. One might
            show an electron’s position; another might show it’s
            momentum.
            Some commutative subalgebras contain others, just like
            some open sets of a topological space contain others.
            The analogy is a good one, except there’s no one
            commutative subalgebra that contains all the others.
            Topos theory is a kind of "local" version of logic,
            but where the concept of locality goes way beyond the
            ordinary notion from topology. In topology, we say a
            property makes sense "locally" if it makes sense for
            points in some particular open set. In the
            Döring-Isham setup, a property makes sense "locally"
            if it makes sense "within a particular classical
            snapshot of reality" – that is, relative to a
            particular commutative subalgebra.
            (Speaking of topology and its generalizations, this
            work on topoi and physics is related to the "étale
            topology" idea I mentioned a while back – but
            technically it’s much simpler. The [106]étale topology
            lets you define a topos of [107]sheaves on a certain
            category. The Döring-Isham work just uses the topos of
            [108]presheaves on the poset of commutative
            subalgebras. Trust me – while this may sound scary,
            it’s much easier.)
            Döring and Isham set up a whole program for doing
            physics "within a topos", based on existing ideas on
            how to do math in a topos. You can do vast amounts of
            math inside any topos just as if you were in the
            ordinary world of set theory – but using
            intuitionistic logic instead of classical logic.
            Intuitionistic logic denies the principle of excluded
            middle, namely:


     "For any statement P, either P is true or not(P) is true."
            In Döring and Isham’s setup, if you pick a commutative
            subalgebra that contains the position of an electron
            as one of its observables, it can’t contain the
            electron’s momentum. That’s because these observables
            don’t commute: you can’t measure them both
            simultaneously. So, working "locally" – that is,
            relative to this particular subalgebra – the statement

             P = "the momentum of the electron is zero"
            is neither true nor false! It’s just not defined.
            Their work has inspired this very nice paper:
            15) Chris Heunen and Bas Spitters, A topos for
            algebraic quantum theory, available as
            [109]arXiv:0709.4364.
            so let me explain that too.
            I said you can do a lot of math inside a topos. In
            particular, you can define an algebra of observables –
            or technically, a "C*-algebra".
            By the Isham-Döring work I just sketched, any
            C*-algebra of observables gives a topos. Heunen and
            Spitters show that the original C*-algebra gives rise
            to a C*-algebra in this topos, which is commutative
            even if the original one was noncommutative! That
            actually makes sense, since in this setup each "local
            view" of the full quantum reality is classical.
            So, they get this sort of picture:


                                [110]
                        [heunen_spitters.jpg]
            I’ve been taking the “ambient topos” to be the
            familiar category of sets, but it could be something
            else.
            What’s really neat is that the Gelfand-Naimark
            theorem, saying commutative C*-algebras are always
            algebras of continuous functions on compact Hausdorff
            spaces, can be generalized to work within any topos.
            So, we get a space in our topos such that observables
            of the C*-algebra in the topos are just functions on
            this space.
            I know this sounds technical if you’re not into this
            stuff. But it’s really quite wonderful. It basically
            means this: using topos logic, we can talk about a
            classical space of states for a quantum system!
            However, this space typically has "no global points" –
            that’s called the “Kochen-Specker theorem”. In other
            words, there’s no overall classical reality that
            matches all the classical snapshots.

                 considering that topoi already have Dedekind
                 reals?” And “Does the replacement for the reals
                 imply that spectral theory must be rebuilt from
                 scratch?”
                 But I feel I should not pursue this now, and

            Yes! It’s always good, when you hear about some
            phenomenon in some theory that has time reversal
            symmetry, to think about its time-reversed version. So
            if particles shooting off to infinity and disappearing
            in finite time sounds “weird but acceptable” you
            should ask whether particles suddenly shooting in from
            infinity when they weren’t there before is also
            acceptable.
            I forgot to mention this in my article. But later I’ll
            talk about white holes and some weird time-reversal
            issues in the classical electrodynamics of point
            particles.

     It also never sunk in that (if I understand your

                 Thanks! I don’t understand the paper, but that’s
                 OK. Its existence answers my question with a
                 ‘yes’. And it does seem intuitive that it would
                 be the communication channels that are the
                 resource objects:


     Our third example is the resource theory of communication,
     as developed by Shannon in his foundational work which
     established information theory. It has communication
     channels—
     mathematically formalized by stochastic matrices—as resource
     objects. These can be converted into each other
     by pre- and post-processing using representing encoding and
     decoding operations. Two such communication
     channels can be combined by using them in parallel. In this
     way, the resource theory of communication is
     described by an ordered commutative monoid denoted CommCh.
     Unfortunately, we do not yet know how to deal
     with the analytic details in Shannon’s theory having to do
     with allowing small errors of communication in order
     to optimize throughput. Therefore we consider CommCh mostly
     because of its close relation with Grph in terms of
     zero-error communication, and also to give some idea of what
     the challenges for improving our present approach
     are. We hope to achieve a comprehensive resource-theoretic
     treatment of Shannon’s theorems in future work.

       In this series we’re looking at mathematical problems that
       arise in physics due to treating spacetime as a
       continuum—basically, problems with infinities.
       In Part 1 we looked at classical point particles
       interacting gravitationally. We saw they could convert an
       infinite amount of potential energy into kinetic energy in
       a finite time! Then we switched to electromagnetism, and
       went a bit beyond traditional Newtonian mechanics: in Part
       2 we threw quantum mechanics into the mix, and in Part 3 we
       threw in special relativity. Briefly, quantum mechanics
       made things better, but special relativity made things
       worse.
       Now let’s throw in both!

       Here are my quibbles. Newtonian mechanics in general and
       Newtonian gravity in particular models physical systems as
       flows of smooth vector fields on smooth manifolds. ( In the
       case of n massive particles interacting by Newton’s law the
       vector field lives on the tangent bundle of
       {\mathbb{R}^3}^n minus “polydiagonals.”) But integral
       curves of smooth vector fields can easily run off to
       infinity in finite time. And flows of smooth vector fields
       can be chaotic. So why would it be surprising that these
       things (incompleteness of the vector field and chaos)
       happen in Newtonian n body problem? It’s more shocking that
       the 2-body problem is completely integrable.
       One may be surprised that “deterministic” (existence,
       uniqueness and smooth dependence on initial conditions)
       doesn’t mean “predictable in practice.” It seems to me that
       this kind of surprise has nothing to do with Newtonian
       physics and more of a problem of a failure of imagination.
       It’s hard to imagine what a complex system may do (by
       definition of complex).

            Thanks for explaining your quibbles. None of them move
            me to change what I wrote, because they basically
            depend on what counts as “surprising”, which is highly
            subjective.
            As a writer, it’s generally a better strategy to say
            “this is surprising” and then explain it, than to say
            “if you’re smart, this will not be surprising”.
            Continuing my counter-nitpicking:
            I didn’t mention chaos at all; that’s not part of the
            theme in this series. I’m not getting into the issue
            of ‘in practice’ predictability, just ‘in principle’
            predictability. So, one main theme is whether the most
            famous theories of physics lead to well-defined time
            evolution given initial data—or for quantum field
            theory (where the initial value problem is too hard)
            whether we can define the amplitude of having some
            particles with some momenta at future infinity given
            similar data at past infinity.
            Most physicists would not be surprised at the
            collision singularities in the Newtonian gravitational
            n-body problem. They would be surprised by
            non-collision singularities where particles manage to
            ‘mine’ an infinite amount of potential energy and
            convert it to kinetic energy in a finite amount of
            time. The battle between kinetic and potential energy
            is a second theme of this series. In the quantum
            version of the Newtonian gravitational n-body problem,
            kinetic energy triumphs over potential energy and all
            is well. In perturbative QED, where arbitrarily large
            numbers of particles can be created, potential energy
            fights back! — and thus, Dyson argues, the power
            series diverge.
            Physicists would attempt to shrug off both the
            collision and non-collision singularities in the
            Newtonian gravitational n-body problem by arguing that
            they occur only for initial data in a set of measure
            zero.
            If this is true, we can define time evolution not for
            individual points on phase space but for probability
            distributions on phase space—or we can use
            [153]‘Koopmanism’ to define time evolution as a
            strongly continuous 1-parameter unitary group on L^2
            of the phase space.
            But in fact nobody has proved this is true except for
            low n. I think most physicists would find that
            surprising.
            So, another general theme is that a lot of basic
            questions about our favorite theories of physics, like
            the extent to which they allow us to predict the
            future in principle, remain unsettled. And, this tends
            to be connected to infinities that arise when there
            are states of arbitrarily negative potential energy.
            On second thought, there probably is something I
            should change about my paper: I should probably add
            some remarks like this to the Conclusion, which right
            now is rather hasty.

            I think this is fairly easy: take two heavy billiard

            bouncing back and forth between them. Assume this is
            in 1-dimensional space – or in other words, they’re
            all moving along a line. I haven’t done the
            calculation, but I think the light one can bounce back
            and forth infinitely many times before all three
            touch.
            This reminds me a bit of that joke about John von
            Neumann, who was famous for being quick at
            calculations:
            Von Neumann and a friend were on a train, and they

            puzzle.
            “Suppose two trains on the same track begin a mile
            apart and head towards each other at 60 miles an hour.
            A fly starting at the front of one train flies at 120
            mph to the other train, and then flies back to the
            first train, and so on, back and forth until it gets
            squashed when the trains collide. How far does the fly
            travel?”
            Von Neumann thought about it a moment and said, “One
            mile”.
            His friend said. “Wow! You’re really good. Most people
            don’t notice the easy way to solve it: the trains meet
            in half a minute, and the fly can travel 1 mile in
            half a minute. They think they have to sum an infinite
            series!”
            Von Neumann looked stunned, and said “But that’s how I
            did it.”

                 My kids (4/7) have a magazine called “Crazy
                 Words” (circulation 20). One of the long running
                 columns is “Collisions We’d Like to See” with
                 examples such as Butter —> Peanut Butter. I will
                 see if the editors want to publish “Von Neumann
                 —> Infinite Series”. Anyway, I tried to run this
                 on the computer. May be I ran my numbers wrong,
                 but it seemed simple enough, and it didn’t work.
                 You can have arbitrary many collisions with this
                 configuration, but eventually the balls stop
                 colliding (and surprisingly quickly).
                 I thought the answer was, no, you can’t have
                 infinitely many. But I don’t know the proof.

       This is a fascinating series. One minor point though. The
       first occurrence of the word “velocity” in Part 1 should be
       changed to “acceleration”. (For equal mass point particles,
       their velocities changes sign just before and just after
       they collide at t=0. Mathematically the velocity is a step
       function undefined at t=0. Physically it seems reasonable
       to define v = 0 at t = 0.)
