[24]Sums of primitive roots


   Posted on [25]November 9, 2016 by [26]Brent


   In [27]my previous post, we saw that adding up all the complex
   n th roots of unity always yields zero (unless n=1 , in which
   case the sum is 1 ). Intuitively, this is because the roots are
   symmetrically distributed around the unit circle, so their
   contributions to the sum all cancel out.


   Today I want to consider the question: what happens when we add
   up only the [28]primitive n th roots of unity? Recall that a
   primitive n th root is one which is not also an m th root for
   some smaller m < n . As points on the unit circle, the
   primitive roots correspond to the [29]spokes which are
   relatively prime to n .


   In some cases we clearly still get zero, again because of
   symmetry. Shown below are n = 4 , 8 , 9 , and 12 :

   For n=1 we of course get 1 again:

   For n=2 the only primitive root is -1 , so the sum is clearly
   -1 . It’s not too hard to see that the sum of primitive roots
   for n=3 will also be -1 :

   Why is that? Well, when n=3 , the only root that is not a
   primitive root is 1 , so if we subtract out 1 from the sum of
   all roots, we are left with the sum of the remaining, primitive
   roots. But we know the sum of all roots is zero, and hence the
   sum of the remaining primitive roots must be -1 . In fact, this
   is not specific to n=3 ; the same argument applies to any prime
   number. When n is prime, every root is primitive except for 1
   itself, so in order for the sum of all the roots to be zero,
   the sum of all the primitive roots must be -1 .

   However, this still leaves other values of n where it is not
   obvious what we will get as the sum of primitive roots. For
   example, here are n=10 , 14 , and 15 :

   Let’s look at n=10 . The primitive roots have reflection
   symmetry across the x -axis, so their sum must lie somewhere on
   the x -axis (since their “up-down pulls” cancel out). Since
   they are leaning more in the positive direction, the sum will
   be bigger than zero. But how much bigger? Just thinking about
   the x components, we are adding together irrational numbers
   involving things like the cosine of \pi/5 , so maybe we just
   get some weird irrational sum like 0.8267834852\dots ? It seems
   plausible, but actually, we don’t: we instead get a sum of…
   exactly 1 ! And the sums for n=14 and n=15 … are also exactly 1
   . Something strange is going on.

   But you don’t have to take my word for it! Next time we’ll put
   together what we know about the [30]sum of all roots and how
   the [31]set of n th roots is made up of primitive roots for the
   divisors of n to compute sums of primitive roots.
