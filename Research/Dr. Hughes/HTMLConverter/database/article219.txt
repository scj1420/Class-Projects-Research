   Collaborative prime number searching website [40]PrimeGrid has
   announced its most recent discovery: on 14th September,
   [41]user Tom Greer discovered a new pair of twin primes (primes
   which differ by 2), namely:


   \[2996863034895 \times 2^{1290000} \pm 1\]

   Found using PrimeGrid’s Sophie Germain Prime search, the new
   discoveries are 388,342 digits long, smashing the previous twin
   prime record of 200,700 digits.

   PrimeGrid is a collaborative project (similar to [42]GIMPS,
   which searches for specifically Mersenne Primes) in which
   anyone who downloads their software can donate their unused CPU
   time to prime searching. It’s been the source of many recent
   prime number discoveries, including several in the last few
   months which rank in the top 160 largest known primes.


   The University of Tennessee Martin’s [43]Chris Caldwell
   maintains a [44]database of the largest known primes, to which
   the new discovery has been added.
