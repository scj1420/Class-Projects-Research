   Following Melania’s [35]now-infamous speech from the Republican
   Convention, a Canadian physicist has calculated the odds of
   those words and phrases appearing in the same order as Michelle
   Obama’s speech eight years ago. Looking at his answer, let’s
   just say it would be a coincidence of cosmic proportions.


   According to Canadian physicist and McGill University professor
   [36]Robert Rutledge, the odds are 1 in 87 billion. To put that
   into perspective, that’s about 7,000 times less likely than
   winning the lottery (the 6/49 to be exact), and about 9,000
   times less likely than being struck by lightning—twice, in a
   lifetime.


   Rutledge decided to do the calculation after listening to
   several Republicans defend Melania, the wife of Republican
   nominee Donald Trump, arguing there are only so many words in
   the English language, and that she was bound to use some of the
   words and phrases used by Michelle Obama. Paul Manafort of the
   Trump campaign [37]rushed to Melania’s defense, saying it
   wasn’t a big deal, and that there are only so many words in the
   English language. It was even argued that [38]Twilight Sparkle
   said it first, and that [39]only a small fraction of the speech
   was plagiarized, which apparently makes it okay.

   As [41]Rutledge told Global News, “I thought, ‘that’s sort of
   silly.’ I’m a physicist, so when things come up that you can
   mathematically model, that’s sort of the thing we do.” The
   physicist then asked a basic, calculable question, “What is the
   probability that, giving Melania Trump the same distinct
   phrases as used by Michelle Obama, they are used in exactly the
   same order?” He came up with 14 “distinct” phases in both
   speeches, i.e. phrases replaceable with synonyms, and came up
   with this [42]N factorial formula:

     14*13*12*11*10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1

   “According to this calculation, there are a grand total of
   about 87 billion different permutations for those 14 distinct
   phrases,” noted Rutledge at his [43]Facebook page. “That’s
   87,000,000,000—or about the number of stars in the Milky Way
   Galaxy.”


   Hmmm, wondering the odds that Melania and her defenders will
   actually understand this calculation...

   Correction: An earlier version stated the odds were 1 in 87
   million. It’s actually one in 87 billion.

   Update: it’s all but been confirmed that the speech was
   plagiarized.
