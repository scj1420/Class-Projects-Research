   In this video the Mathologer sets out to commit the perfect
   murder using infinitely many assassins and, subsequently, to
   get them off the hook in court. The story is broken up into
   three very tricky puzzles. Challenge yourself to figure them
   out before the Mathologer reveals his own solutions. Featuring
   Batman, the controversial Axiom of Choice and a guest
   appearance by the Banach-Tarski paradox.
   The pictures that I used for the Banach-Tarski ball splitting
   action were grabbed off the brilliant VSauce's video on the
   mainly did this for easy reference since most people here will
   have seen this video and in this way would be able to connect
   easily with what I am talking about here.
   I also mention that those sets that get pushed around in the
   Banach-Tarski paradox are constructed using the Axiom of
   Choice. Vsauce actually does not mention this although this is
   really a big deal as far as mathematics is concerned
   (understandable though since his video was already very long).
   Here is a link to the spot in the Vsauce video where the Axiom
   of Choice is envoked (although you have to have a really close
   There is a very nice TEDed video about the finite version of
   solutions to both the infinite and the finite version are
   closely related.

   Thank you very much to Danil Dmitriev the official Mathologer
   translator for Russian for his subtitles.
   Enjoy!
