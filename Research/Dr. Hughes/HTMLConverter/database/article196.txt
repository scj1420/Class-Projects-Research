   Even veteran mathematicians will be impressed by the breadth of
   applications of mathematics included in this book. It is a
   conclusive item of evidence of how valuable a large set of
   applied mathematicians is to the modern industrial state. In
   fact they are essential to its continuance.

   The papers are organized into eight parts:

   There are three to five papers in each category.

   Each of the papers is basically a summary. The best description
   is encapsulated in a sentence from the article called The
   Reduction of Sound from Aircraft Engines: “The previous section
   gives only the mathematical essence of the idea used.” In each
   case, however, there is enough to give the reader a fundamental
   understanding of the problem, the mathematics used to address
   the issues, and some of the basic results. Of course, there are
   a series of references at the end of each paper to point the
   interested reader in the right direction.

   Even if the reader finds the mathematics being used in a
   specific problem difficult to understand, they can still enjoy
   looking through it. It warms the heart to know that one is part
   of such a valuable and essential element of the modern world.
