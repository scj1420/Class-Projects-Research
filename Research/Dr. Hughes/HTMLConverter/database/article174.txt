   March Madness is finally here. The field is set for the 2017
   NCAA tournament, with Sunday night’s selection show revealing
   this year’s bracket. Time

   March Madness, indeed! By the time you read this, 68 teams will
   have been selected and seeded for the NCAA Division I men’s
   basketball tournament.

   Along with the excitement of cheering for your favorite team
   and against your rivals, you will likely spend hours pondering
   and making your bracket choices.

   But we all hear stories about bracket winners choosing their
   teams by uniform colors. That can’t really be the best method,
   can it? Does a more analytical approach yield better results?
   That’s what the students in my 2016 honors seminar,
   "Discovering Sports Analytics," tried to find out and the short
   answer is, yes, analytical methods generally are better!

   My Central students learned to use analytical methods to create
   brackets that were as objective, yet predictive, as possible.
   They studied the [60]Colley and [61]Massey methods, two
   techniques for rating and ranking teams that involve matrices
   and linear algebra. The Colley method does not take margin of
   victory into account, while the Massey method does. Both
   methods are capable of placing different values on games
   depending on how early or late in the season the games were
   played.

   million


   Students had to make decisions regarding such variables as how
   much weight to assign home, away or neutral games, the value of
   games as the season progresses, and the maximum margin of
   victory that should be considered, since one can argue there is
   not much difference in the value of a team winning by 40 or by
   70 points.

   Bracketologists have devised more than 100 methods for rating
   and ranking tournament teams. Good resources include Ken
   Pomeroy’s [63]KenPom ratings, [64]FiveThirtyEight sports  and
   [65]Sports Reference College Basketball. I asked students to
   create two tournament brackets for our class competition: a
   “heart” bracket, created through the eyeball test and gut
   feelings, and a “head” bracket, created exclusively through
   analytical methods.


   As a class we also created brackets using the Colley and Massey
   methods with a variety of weighting schemes. The results, a
   sample of which is shown in the table below, were quite good
   despite all of them having incorrectly predicted Kansas as the
   national champion. From my students’ analytical brackets, 79
   percent were in the top half of all brackets submitted to ESPN
   with four of them ranking in the top 87 percent. Contrast that
   with only 50 percent of their "heart" brackets ranking even in
   the top 50 percent. The top performing student was junior
   Jordan Saddoris of Ankeny, whose fivethirtyeight.com-inspired
   "head" bracket ranked in the top 92.7 percent, only slightly
   ahead of my not-too-shabby "heart" bracket. As a result, you
   don’t necessarily have to rely on analytics to be successful,
   but doing so does improve your chances.

   As you ponder the options, also consider these fun facts:

       seeds.
       tournaments since 1985. In fact, three of four No. 12 seeds
       won their first-round game three times: 2013, 2009 and
       2002.
       and 2011, when no No. 1 seeds made it to the Final Four. On
       the other hand, 2008 is the only year all four No. 1 seeds
       made the Final Four.

   No matter which method you use, some of your picks will be
   brilliant, some will be clunkers, and you are very likely to
   eventually look at the remains of your bracket and mutter “how
   did it come to this?” Take heart in knowing you did all you
   could to produce your best possible bracket and that you
   embraced the March Madness.
