   Mathematical analysis has led researchers in Japan to a formula
   that can describe the movement of DNA inside living human
   cells. Using these calculations, researchers may be able to
   reveal the 3D architecture of the human genome. In the future,
   these results may allow scientists to understand in detail how
   DNA is organized and accessed by essential cellular machinery.

   Previous techniques of studying the genome's architecture have
   relied on methods that require killing the cells. This research
   project, involving collaborators at multiple institutes in
   Japan, used alternative molecular and cell biology techniques
   to keep the cells alive and collect data about the natural
   movement of DNA.

   DNA is often envisaged as a stable and static code, but the
   genome as a whole is actually an active molecule that moves
   around and changes shape. Currently, scientists can sequence
   the entire basic code of DNA, but knowing the larger-scale 3D
   architecture of the genome would reveal more information about
   how cells use the code.

   While the cell is growing, DNA is stored as an unraveled spool
   of string; certain portions (euchromatin) are more loosely
   wound, and therefore accessible to the cellular machinery that
   turns DNA into protein, than other areas that are kept tightly
   wound (heterochromatin). When the cell prepares to split in
   half during cell division, it packages all of the chromatin
   into tightly-wound, X-shaped chromosomes.

   "Our calculations consider the fractal dimensions of the DNA,
   which shows how densely the DNA is packed inside the cell. The
   way the DNA is packed may indicate how the cell uses certain
   genes," said Soya Shinkai, PhD, Assistant Professor at
   Hiroshima University and first author of the research paper.

   Along the "string" of chromatin are regularly-spaced,
   barrel-shaped "beads" of DNA-protein complexes called
   nucleosomes. Researchers tracked nucleosomes' movement around
   the cell to understand where and how chromatin is stored.

   Researchers labeled the nucleosomes with fluorescent tags and
   took microscopy images during the growth phase of human cells.
   They then used theories of polymer physics to quantify the
   movement of the nucleosomes.

   "Every second, a 10 nanometer-sized nucleosome can move 100
   nanometers. The constant, subtle random forces within the cell
   make the chromatin move around so much," said Shinkai.

   Before a cell can use a gene, the DNA must be completely
   unwound. Areas of chromatin containing frequently used genes
   are less tightly wrapped than areas of chromatin with
   infrequently used genes. A model to visualize how chromatin is
   packed within the cell could allow researchers to understand
   which genes are accessed most or least often and how the genome
   is physically organized.

   "Our calculations are relevant to local chromatin structures,
   but this method could also be extended to whole chromosomes.
   These mathematical formulas are a theory for how to interpret
   the visual data from microscope images of DNA moving within the
   cell," said Yuichi Togashi, PhD, Associate Professor at
   Hiroshima University and last author of the research paper.

   Future research projects will include finding new microscopy
   and DNA labeling techniques to visually track the movement of
   individual nucleosomes over longer periods time.

   The four researchers who published the recent paper are experts
   in theoretical and computational biophysics, structural
   biology, cell biology, and molecular biology. The results come
   from a research project made possible by an interdisciplinary
   team of scientists associated with the Research Center for the
   Mathematics on Chromatin Live Dynamics at Hiroshima University.
   Other collaborators for the project include the National
   Institute of Genetics (Japan), Keio University, and Sokendai
   Graduate University for Advanced Studies.
