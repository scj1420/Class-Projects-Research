   COLUMBUS, Ohio --Young people decide whether they've had enough
   to drink the same way the cruise control on a car "decides"
   whether to accelerate or hit the brakes.

   That's a preliminary finding in an unusual new study that aims
   to analyze drinking behavior the way engineers might analyze a
   mechanical system.

   In two papers to appear in the journal IEEE Transactions on
   Cybernetics, a team of social workers and engineers at The Ohio
   State University used mathematical models to help explain the
   factors that drive alcohol consumption.

   They found that college students drank until they attained a
   certain level of drunkenness, and then adjusted the pace of
   their drinking--sipping versus gulping, for example, or
   switching to a non-alcoholic beverage -- at different times
   throughout the night to maintain that level.

   John Clapp, a professor of social work and director of the
   Higher Education Center for Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention
   and Recovery at Ohio State, has been gathering data on
   high-risk drinking among college students for more than a
   decade. He and his colleagues believe that analyzing all that
   data via engineering methods might reveal relationships among
   complex factors that would otherwise remain hidden.

   "We're looking for the best points to intervene strategically,
   so that we can aid a person in their decision-making and
   potentially derail problematic behaviors," Clapp said.

   As a first test of their idea, Clapp asked Ohio State engineer
   Kevin Passino to re-analyze data that Clapp and his former
   research team at San Diego State University collected on
   students at parties and bars in San Diego. They performed
   portable alcohol breath tests, and over several studies, they
   accumulated blood alcohol content (BAC) data on nearly 1,500
   students.

   Passino, professor of electrical and computer engineering and
   director of Ohio State's Humanitarian Engineering Center,
   searched the data for patterns that might resemble a typical
   engineering problem. He and former doctoral student Luis Felipe
   Giraldo were surprised by what they found.

   "The way the students made decisions about drinking actually
   resembled the single most common feedback controller that's
   used in engineering," Passino said. "It's called a
   proportional-derivative controller, and it measures how far a
   system has moved from a particular set point and adjusts
   accordingly. It's the same as cruise control on a car."

   At the start of the evening, the researchers quizzed the
   students about how drunk they intended to get, and then they
   tested the students' BAC several times over the following
   hours. The data showed that students who reported wanting to
   feel "buzzed" adjusted their consumption to maintain a BAC
   around 0.05, while those who said they planned to get "very
   drunk" averaged around 0.1.

   BAC is a percentage measure of alcohol in the blood, and in
   Ohio as in California and the rest of the United States, it's
   illegal to drive a car with a BAC of 0.08 or higher.

   To Clapp, knowing that the patterns fit a particular
   engineering controller means that the researchers can apply new
   types of equations to dig deeper into the data they've already
   collected, and take a more dynamic view of students' drinking
   behaviors in the future.

   "We have a sense of what factors influence drinking behavior as
   is occurs naturally, but we don't really understand how it all
   works together. It's as if we've been taking Polaroid snapshots
   of these really complex behaviors, and now we'll be able to
   capture high-definition movies," he said.

   This first study provides a proof of concept for a new study
   about to begin on the Ohio State Columbus campus, one that will
   create very large and complex data sets on the scale of "big
   data."

   Sixty Ohio State seniors -- belonging to several different
   social groups consisting of friends who go out drinking
   together on the weekends -- will wear trans-dermal blood
   alcohol monitors so that the researchers can get more precise
   data on how their BAC varies over an entire night out. The
   monitors are being provided by SCRAM Systems, a company that
   supplies similar ankle bracelets to law enforcement. The
   sensors are about the size of a hockey puck, and measure BAC
   through the wearer's sweat.

   The students, who are all of legal drinking age, will wear the
   ankle bracelets when they go out on the weekends. But for the
   entire two-week study, they will also wear personal fitness
   monitors so that researchers can track data such as their sleep
   and exercise habits. In surveys transmitted to their cell
   phones at random times throughout the study, the students will
   answer questions about their health and well-being, such as
   their emotional state at that moment.

   "We could track as many as 5,000 different variables per person
   during that two-week period, plus all the social interactions
   between the people in the different groups," Clapp said. "We're
   hoping to get a very rich, complex dataset, and most social
   science methods wouldn't lend themselves well to untangling all
   of that."

   Passino described how an engineer might untangle it.

   "One approach would be to take this complex system, which is
   composed of a set of people with their drinking habits and
   their social interactions with each other, and try to make a
   model that's as realistic as possible, and then analyze that
   model for something called controllability," he said.

   "Controllability is just what you'd think: How easy is it for
   you to change this system? You can test for controllability
   with mathematics, and we're hoping that doing so will suggest
   some ideas for an intervention."

   Their ultimate goal is to develop a smartphone app that will
   alert a young person--or anyone else, for that matter--when
   they've had enough to drink.

   Clapp envisions that users could tell the app whether they want
   to moderate their drinking on a particular evening. Based on
   transdermal BAC, the app could then send an alert to suggest
   that the user eat something or drink a non-alcoholic beverage
   before they have another alcoholic one. Smartphones already
   know a user's location and whether they drove to get there, so
   the app could also remind a drinker not to drive home and help
   with calling a cab.

   Soon, law enforcement-style ankle bracelets won't be necessary
   for such an app to work.

   The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recently
   sponsored a design competition for an easy-to-wear commercial
   BAC biosensor. The winner, called the BACtrack Skyn, will go on
   sale in January 2017 for around $99. It resembles a fitness
   monitor and communicates with a smartphone via Bluetooth.

   While such devices could potentially provide researchers with
   an abundance of data, there are very few universities currently
   equipped to analyze it with a hybrid social work-engineering
   approach. Clapp knows of only two other research groups -- one
   at Washington University at Saint Louis and the other at the
   University of Southern California -- with similar
   collaborations.


   Study co-author Giraldo is now an assistant professor of
   electrical and electronics engineering at Universidad de los
   Andes in Colombia. Other collaborators include Danielle
   Ruderman, a doctoral student in social work at Ohio State, and
   Hugo Gonzalez, a doctoral student in electrical and computer
   engineering.
