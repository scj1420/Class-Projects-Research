   A nonic surface is one defined by a polynomial equation of
   degree 9. This image by [18]Juan García Escudero shows a nonic
   surface called \(Q_9\), which has 220 real ordinary double
   points: that is, points where it looks like the origin of the
   cone in 3-dimensional space defined by


   $$ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 .$$

   Here are some other pictures of this surface, made by
   [19]Abdelaziz Nait Merzouk:

   In 1983, Varchenko showed that the maximum number of ordinary
   double points for a complex nonic surface with no other
   singularities is ≤ 246:

   • Alexander N. Varchenko, On the semicontinuity of the spectrum
   and an upper bound for the number of singular points of a
   projective hypersurface, J. Soviet Math. 27 (1983), 735–739.

   These double points might or might not appear in a real form of
   the surface. In his 2005 thesis, Labs described a nonic surface
   with 226 complex nodes:

   Singularities—History, Constructions, Algorithms,
   Visualization, Department of Mathematics, Johannes Gutenberg
   University of Mainz, 2005.


   but not all these are real. In 2008, Breske, Labs and van
   Straten showed how to construct a nonic with 216 real ordinary
   double points:

   • Sonja Breske, Oliver Labs and Duco van Straten, [24]Real line
   arrangements and surfaces with many real nodes, in B. Jüttler
   and R. Piene, eds., Geometric Modeling and Algebraic Geometry,
   Springer, Berlin, 2008, pp. 47–54.


   The largest known number of real ordinary double points for a
   nonic surface with no other singularities is currently 220,
   obtained by Escudero:

   • Juan García Escudero, [25]A construction of algebraic
   surfaces with many real nodes, Annali di Matematica 195 (2016),
   571–583.


   In addition to the surface \(Q_9\) shown above, he found and
   drew another, called \(\tilde{Q}_9\):

   Escudero Nonic \(\tilde{Q}_9\) – Juan García Escudero

   Both of these are defined using Chebyshev polynomials and
   arrangements of lines related to substitution tilings. The
   technique works more generally to provide surfaces of degree
   \(3n\) with many real double points. See his paper for a
   picture of a degree 12 surface with 582 real double points, and
   a degree 15 surface with 1162.

   nonic \(Q_9\) and made them available [27]on Google+ under a
