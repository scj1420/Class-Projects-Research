   How economically inefficient! ([192]Library of Congress)


   In the grade-school version of American history, the
   Revolutionary War seems like a righteous inevitability. The
   typical narrative conflates taxes with tyranny, casting the
   rebellion as a break from British greed and oppression. “King
   George III didn’t seem to care what the colonists thought,” one
   children’s book [193]explains. “He needed more and more money,
   so Great Britain’s Parliament passed more and more taxes on the
   colonies.”


   Such mythologizing is dangerous because it creates the false
   impression that the nation was conceived out of an allergy to
   taxation. You see this fable [194]repeated in slogans from the
   Tea Party, the latest in a long [195]tradition of activists
   attempting to dragoon the Founding Fathers into their arguments
   for reducing taxes.


   In truth, the British only wanted the colonists to start paying
   their fair share of public expenses. And the colonists
   themselves weren’t opposed to taxation in principle; they were
   angry that they had no official say in the matter, since they
   had no seats in the British Parliament. As the famous slogan
   goes, the colonists bristled at “taxation without
   representation.”

   Which raises one of the chief mysteries of that era: Why
   couldn’t both sides arrive at a peaceful compromise? The
   prosperous American colonies were a jewel of the British
   Empire. If the Americans were so incensed at their lack of
   representation, there seemed to be an obvious solution — just
   bring the colonists into Parliament.

   Economists Sebastian Galiani and Gustavo Torrens think they
   understand why that never happened. In a [196]new working
   paper, they analyze the American Revolution through the lens of
   game theory, the mathematical study of strategy and conflict.
   The economists argue there was an underlying logic to why both
   sides deadlocked. They believe their theory, which stresses
   political machinations rather than patriotic fervor as the
   engine of schism, might help us better understand how
   democracies evolve and how voting rights spread.


   If it seems strange for economists to weigh in on these matters
   — it’s not. There is a fertile tradition of economists opining
   on political institutions, beginning with Adam Smith, who
   himself wrote about the problems of the American colonies in
   "The Wealth of Nations."

   For the British, the main headache was that the colonies
   weren’t pulling their own weight. In the 1750s and 1760s, the
   British spent millions of pounds raising armies to defend the
   North American colonies against the French in the Seven Years’
   War. Parliament subsequently demanded that the lightly-taxed
   Americans should contribute more to the costs of their own
   defense.

   This was a reasonable idea, Smith argued. And the new taxes
   were still a pittance compared to what people paid in England.
   Parliament had never demanded of the colonists anything "which
   even approached to a just proportion to what was paid by their
   fellow subjects at home,” Smith [197]noted in his book, which
   was published in 1776, not quite a year into the American
   Revolution.


   Still, Smith was an advocate for harmony and economic
   efficiency. If the Americans would not pay taxes without
   political representation, he argued that the most practical
   solution was to acquiesce. He recommended that Britain should
   grant the colonies some number of seats in Parliament,
   depending on how much they contributed in taxes.

   He wasn’t the only one to come up with this idea. In the run-up
   to the Revolution, several similar proposals had circulated on
   both sides of the Atlantic. The British politician Thomas
   Pownall [198]dreamed of a merged Parliament, a “Grand Marine
   Dominion, consisting of our possessions in the Atlantic, and in
   America, united into a one Empire.” In 1754, Benjamin Franklin
   [199]wrote that “such a union would be very acceptable to the
   colonies, provided they had a reasonable number of
   representatives allowed them.”


   So why didn’t any of these plans come through?

   Galiani and Torrens argue that political considerations in
   Britain wrecked any chance of Americans gaining seats in
   Parliament. “It was not that such a deal was impossible to
   reach, or that it was completely crazy,” Torrens said in an
   interview. “Part of the problem is that this would have
   consequences for the internal politics of the British empire.”

   As they discuss in their paper, the British Parliament at the
   time was dominated by wealthy landowners, who feared that the
   nation’s growing democratic movement would diminish their
   power. The common folk, who made up most of the country, were
   agitating for more say and more representation in Parliament.

   “The landed gentry, who controlled the incumbent government,
   feared that making concessions to the American colonies would
   intensify the pressure for democratic reforms, thus
   jeopardizing their economic and political position,” the
   economists argue.

   “There was this slippery-slope argument,” Torrens said. “How
   could they give representation to the Americans, while many
   common people in London did not have proper representation?”

   In fact, there were populist factions in the British government
   who welcomed the colonists — in part, it seems, because they
   thought the Americans would make good allies. It was a volatile
   period. According to Galiani and Torrens, the ruling class in
   Britain believed it was better to risk a war and the loss of
   some colonies than to risk losing control of the entire empire
   to a political coalition of the lowborn and landless. Their
   paper's contribution is to illustrate the strategic logic
   behind this decision.

   Several top historians, when asked about the theory, called it
   intriguing — but they also pointed out that it misses some
   nuances, particularly on the American side of the story. First
   of all, if the British landowners were wary of letting
   Americans into Parliament, the Americans became equally, if not
   more skeptical of such an idea. London was too far away, and
   the colonists suspected they would never amount to more than a
   token presence in the British government.

   “The colonists feared that they would never be the majority,
   that England would make sure it always had more
   representatives, and that the colonies would end up getting
   dragged around being forced to do whatever England wanted to
   do,” said Eliga Gould, a history professor at the University of
   New Hampshire.

   What the colonists really wanted, historians say, was the right
   to vote on taxes in their own assemblies. That’s the true
   significance behind the slogan “no taxation without
   representation,” Alan Taylor, a history professor at the
   University of Virginia, explained in an e-mail. The colonists
   weren’t trying to get into Parliament; they wanted taxes to be
   handled by their local representatives.

   This, too, was a proposal that both sides floated early on.
   Some suggested that the British could tell the Americans how
   much they owed for the services of the army and navy, and the
   colonies could figure out how the raise the money themselves.
   But these plans still left open the question of who had the
   final authority to tax. Was Britain sending a bill or passing
   around a collection basket?

   Ultimately, historians say, this was the sticking point that
   led to the Revolutionary War. When the British passed the
   [200]Stamp Act in 1765, the first direct tax on the American
   colonies, they opened a Pandora’s box of questions. “It raised
   the constitutional problem of who’s in control — where’s the
   ultimate location of sovereignty,” Brendan McConville, a
   history professor at Boston University, said.


   By the late 1760s, he said, the opportunity for compromise had
   more or less faded, as the debate turned to these deeper issues
   of governance and liberty.

   The Revolutionary War was never really about taxes; that much,
   at least, is clear. One popular theory among historians
   describes it as essentially a war waged over principles — an
   argument over the rights promised by British constitutional
   law. Others point out that there were underlying economic
   tensions created by Britain’s trade monopoly. And surely,
   stubbornness and pride played a role as well.

   As the conflict unspooled, the British made many concessions,
   which rankled some of London's ruling class. “One of the
   attitudes in Britain was that it was the British who kept
   giving way. They felt the patriots were demanding more and more
   and the only way to deal with them was to get tough,” said
   Andrew O'Shaughnessy, a history professor at the University of
   Virginia. But colonists were suspicious of the British promises
   to back off on taxation. They didn't want cheap talk; they
   wanted ironclad constitutional guarantees to representation.
   And if they couldn't locate those rights in the British
   constitution, well, they would write their own.

   Some of these issues are surprisingly relevant today. There is
   the perennial [201]complaint that a vote counts more in some
   states than others, and nasty battles over the configuration of
   congressional districts. Such debates are not so far removed
   from the questions about representation that the colonists and
   the British tussled over nearly 300 years ago.


   Both sides agreed that the government must be of the people —
   but to what degree? Then, as now, it was hard to
   distinguish the moral arguments from more self-interested ones.

   At the time, the British stressed the idea of “virtual
   representation.” They claimed that the members of Parliament
   had a duty to look after everyone's welfare, even those who
   couldn’t vote, like the colonists and many English commoners.

   The Americans [202]hated the concept. But in one of history's
   minor ironies, the Founding Fathers would
   later [203]regurgitate that line of thinking when they created
   the District of Columbia. In large part thanks to
   that centuries-old philosophy, the residents of D.C. still
   have [204]no voting representation in Congress today.
