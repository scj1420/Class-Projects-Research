   Welcome to Week 5 of the Wednesday Morning Math Challenge.
   [12]You can find solutions to the Week 4 puzzles here, along
   with — more importantly — discussions of some ways to approach
   them. Remember that the real goal here is to think creatively.


   This week I have three puzzles from my favorite puzzle book,
   The Moscow Puzzles. Translated from Russian, this is the most
   popular puzzle book ever published in the Soviet Union. [13]You
   can check out the book here.


   Here are three puzzles from the book, involving checkers.
     __________________________________________________________

   checkers

   1. Jumping Checkers

   Place 3 white checkers in squares 1, 2, and 3 of the figure,
   and 3 black ones on the squares 5, 6, and 7. Shift the white
   checkers to the squares occupied by the black ones, and vice
   versa. You may move a checker forward to the adjacent
   unoccupied square, if any. You may jump a checker forward over
   an adjacent checker into the vacant square. The solution
   requires 15 moves.

   2. White and Black

   Take 4 black and 4 white checkers (or 4 pennies and 4 other
   coins) and put them on a table in a row, white, black, and so
   on. Leave a vacant place at one end which can hold 2 checkers.
   After 4 moves, all the black checkers should be on one side and
   the white ones on the other.

   A move consists of shifting 2 adjacent checkers, keeping their
   order, into any vacant space.

   3. Complicating the Problem

   In the last problem, 8 checkers took 4 moves. Show how 10
   checkers take 5 moves, 12 take 6, and 14 take 7.
