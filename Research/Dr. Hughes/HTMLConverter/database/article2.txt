   Tilings and Patterns, first published in 1987, has recently
   been re-published by Dover. Although it got outstanding reviews
   following its appearance, the original publisher chose to
   discontinue it in 1998. Dover has once again done the
   mathematical community a service in bringing back such a
   notable volume.

   The authors have left the original unchanged in most respects.
   Besides correcting minor typographical errors, the authors have
   added an appendix with references to new material that has
   appeared in the literature over the intervening decades. Of
   course, this does not make the book completely up to date. (For
   instance, some more recently discovered convex pentagonal
   tilings are not mentioned.) It would be a truly mind-boggling
   task to update the book completely considering how much is here
   already.

   According to their preface the authors began with the idea of
   writing a rigorous book on “visual geometry” that would
   encourage a renewed appreciation of geometry and the use of
   purely geometrical reasoning. Eventually they decided to focus
   on tilings and patterns. They envisioned three distinct groups
   of readers: students, professional mathematicians and a variety
   of non-mathematicians (artists, architects, crystallographers,
   and the like.) Their idea was that the book should be
   accessible to any reader who is attracted to geometry.

   The first part of the book focuses on the basic geometry of
   planar tilings and patterns. A plane tiling is defined broadly
   as a countable family of closed sets that cover the plane
   without gaps or overlaps. However, the authors mostly restrict
   themselves to a class of well-behaved tilings that have
   conditions designed to eliminate undesirable and pathological
   examples. Patterns, which can also be defined very broadly, are
   mostly treated here as repetitions of a motif in the plane in a
   regular manner with certain natural technical restrictions.

   The book starts with an introduction that presents a survey of
   tilings and patterns from a variety of cultures and historical
   periods. Other highlights of the first part of the book are an
   extensive treatment of tilings by regular polygons and
   star-shaped polygons, topological equivalence of tilings by
   homeomorphism, and classifications of tilings according to
   symmetries and transitivity properties. The authors suggest
   that the first seven chapters of the book could be used for an
   undergraduate geometry course.

   The second part of the book looks at a few advanced topics.
   Colored tilings are described at some length. Although colored
   tilings have been far and away the most commonly used tilings
   in the decorative arts, almost no systematic work on them had
   been done before the current book. (Unfortunately, all the
   figures in the book are in grayscale). Aperiodic tilings are
   also treated extensively. Prominent examples include variations
   due to Penrose and Wang. Wang tilings get special attention
   because it is possible to find sets of Wang tiles that can be
   used to mimic the behavior of any Turing machine, and hence
   they are relevant to questions of mathematical logic.

   The most striking feature of the book is its extensive
   collection of figures, including hundreds of examples of
   tilings and patterns. The sheer abundance is perhaps one reason
   why artists and designers have been drawn to it over the years.
   While portions of the book are accessible to those with limited
   mathematical backgrounds, a basic knowledge of topology and
   algebra (and sometime more) is needed to follow the details of
   the development. Nonetheless, this is a book that almost anyone
   would enjoy dipping into.
