   In his new book, Ben Blatt commits sweet blasphemy in
   attempting to suss out—via math—what moves us within
   literature. Nabokov’s Favorite Word Is Mauve delivers a
   statistical study of literature in the vein of Freakonomics,
   revealing that mathematical patterns rule both our physical
   world and the imagined worlds in books.

   But what do numbers actually have to do with writing? Blatt
   himself acknowledges the seeming paradox of it all, yet he sees
   literature for what it is—a massive, searchable collection of
   data points. It helps, of course, that the math involved in
   Blatt’s book is statistics, among the friendliest of numerical
   phyla, and that he approaches the subject with the right mix of
   humor, hand-holding and literary love so as not to present a
   stuffy threat to our beloved works. On the contrary, Blatt
   reads as a devoted fan of the written word seeking to better
   understand it. It just so happens that numbers are the means
   through which he makes a deeper connection.

   Some of the questions Blatt tackles are better suited to
   statistical study than others. A chapter testing the validity
   of writers’ common catechisms—like “don’t us -ly adverbs” and
   “don’t use exclamation points”—reveals how often such rules are
   adhered to or broken. (A great number of them hold in the most
   general sense; the best writers do tend to use -ly adverbs
   less, but any great stylist can break a given rule with
   outlying success.) Even better is Blatt’s proof that some
   authors follow their own advice. Elmore Leonard, that great
   denigrator of the mighty exclamation point, appears to have
   stopped using the mark after publically banning it. The math
   can even be used to support the art, if one is a touch
   generous. What is a writer who breaks these common rules if not
   an example of a powerful, singular voice?

   Some of Blatt’s analyses reach even deeper. Nabokov’s favorite
   word, mauve, may be because the author had synesthesia, for
   example. And Blatt’s examination of male and female authors’
   word choice—and that of male and female characters—titillates
   the armchair anthropologist with what assumptions may be
   reinforced in hundreds of years and millions of words.

   Blatt’s approach sounds unorthodox, because, as he so aptly
   notes, we are used to studying literature in a granular way. We
   spend days, weeks, months on the reading and analysis of one
   work. We draw conclusions about culture and place until we
   exsanguinate it, and then we place it within a broader canon.
   What Blatt’s numbers can do is study the aggregate, massive
   swaths of work that can reveal broader trends than any single
   book can. More data, as far as science is concerned, is always
   better. The more points one can make coalesce into a picture,
   the better the odds of that picture being accurate.

   What numbers add to our understanding of words—and especially
   to literature, to fiction—is a necessary reality; they are
   concrete artifacts of the imaginary. No archeologist would
   discount a vast field of shattered pots, just as no literary
   critic should discount the scattershot distribution—amongst
   gender, time and genre—of such seemingly useless words as
   “everything” and “something.”

   Numbers are not anathema to literature. While Nabokov’s
   Favorite Word Is Mauve is littered with graphs and even a
   couple of frightening formulas, the one which results in the
   Great Work is not among them—and it never will be. The outliers
   Blatt so often highlights prove that. Art and science are not
   enemies or even friends, but symbioses. In relationship with
   each other, they yield insights which would be impossible to
   recognize on their own.
