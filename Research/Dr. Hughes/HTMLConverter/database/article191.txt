   The [23]Chern Medal is a relatively new prize, awarded once
   every four years jointly by the IMU
   and the Chern Medal Foundation (CMF) to an individual whose
   accomplishments warrant
   the highest level of recognition for outstanding achievements
   in the field of mathematics.
   Funded by the CMF, the Medalist receives a cash prize of US$
   250,000.  In addition, each
   Medalist may nominate one or more organizations to receive
   funding totalling US$ 250,000, for the support of research,
   education, or other outreach programs in the field of
   mathematics.


   Professor Chern devoted his life to mathematics, both in active
   research and education, and in nurturing the field whenever the
   opportunity arose. He obtained fundamental results in all the
   major aspects of modern geometry and founded the area of global
   differential geometry. Chern exhibited keen aesthetic tastes in
   his selection of problems, and the breadth of his work deepened
   the connections of geometry with different areas of
   mathematics. He was also generous during his lifetime in his
   personal support of the field.

   Nominations should be sent to the Prize Committee Chair:
