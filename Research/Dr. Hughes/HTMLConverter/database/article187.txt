Conclusion: the ghost in the political machine

   I was fascinated by the recent [46]New Yorker article about
   Tony Schwartz, Trump’s ghostwriter for The Art of the Deal. Of
   particular interest was how Schwartz imitated Trump’s voice and
   philosophy:


     In his journal, Schwartz describes the process of trying to
     make Trump’s voice palatable in the book. It was kind of “a
     trick,” he writes, to mimic Trump’s blunt, staccato,
     no-apologies delivery while making him seem almost boyishly
     appealing…. Looking back at the text now, Schwartz says, “I
     created a character far more winning than Trump actually
     is.”

   Like any journalism, data journalism is ultimately about human
   interest, and there’s one human I’m interested in: who is
   writing these iPhone tweets?

   The majority of the tweets from the iPhone are fairly benign
   declarations. But consider cases like these, both posted from
   an iPhone:

     Like the worthless [47]@NYDailyNews, looks like
     [48]@politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting-
     no money, no cred!
     — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [49]February 10, 2016


     Failing [50]@NYTimes will always take a good story about me
     and make it bad. Every article is unfair and biased. Very
     sad!

   These tweets certainly sound like the Trump we all know. Maybe
   our above analysis isn’t complete: maybe Trump has sometimes,
   however rarely, tweeted from an iPhone (perhaps dictating, or
   just using it when his own battery ran out). But what if our
   hypothesis is right, and these weren’t authored by the
   candidate- just someone trying their best to sound like him?

   Or what about tweets like this (also iPhone), which defend
   Trump’s slogan- but doesn’t really sound like something he’d
   write?

     Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of
     wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair.

   A lot has been written about Trump’s mental state. But I’d
   really rather get inside the head of this anonymous staffer,
   whose job is to imitate Trump’s unique cadence (“Very sad!”),
   or to put a positive spin on it, to millions of followers. Are
   they a true believer, or just a cog in a political machine,
   mixing whatever mainstream appeal they can into the
   @realDonaldTrump concoction? Like Tony Schwartz, will they one
   day regret their involvement?
    1. To keep the post concise I don’t show all of the code,
       especially code that generates figures. But you can find
       the full code [53]here. [54]↩
    2. We had to use a custom regular expression for Twitter,
       since typical tokenizers would split the # off of hashtags
       and @ off of usernames. We also removed links and
       ampersands (&amp;) from the text. [55]↩
    3. The “plus ones,” called [56]Laplace smoothing are to avoid
       dividing by zero and to put [57]more trust in common
       words. [58]↩
