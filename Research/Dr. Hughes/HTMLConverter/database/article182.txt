Assessing Risks to Global Food Security

How Mathematicians Can Help

   By [47]James Case


   The inaugural [48]SIAM Conference on Mathematics of Planet
   Earth, held last September in Philadelphia, Pa., featured a
   public lecture by Molly Jahn of the University of Wisconsin,
   Madison (UW-Madison). Jahn, whose talk was entitled “Risks and
   Resilience in Global Food Systems: An Invitation for
   Mathematicians,” holds appointments in the Department of
   Agronomy, the Global Health Institute, and the Center for
   Sustainability and the Global Environment. She has served as
   dean of the university’s College of Agriculture and Life
   Sciences, director of the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment
   Station, and Deputy and Acting Under Secretary of Research,
   Education, and Economics at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.


   Jahn began her lecture by conceding that the current
   agricultural establishment (farmers, agribusinesses, and the
   agricultural research community) has been “stunningly
   successful” in improving agricultural productivity and
   efficiency. How else could we possibly be feeding a global
   population that has grown from under 2 billion to over 7
   billion in the last century? She hastened to add, however, that
   the existing food delivery system is by no means ideal. It
   leaves some 800 million people undernourished, while 1.5
   billion are overweight or obese. Meanwhile, estimates indicate
   that 1.4 billion tons of food are wasted each year. Though this
   is a small fraction of the total quantity produced, it is still
   significant – more than enough to feed the 1.4 billion people
   subsisting on $1.25 per day, or the 1.5 billion people who
   reside on degrading land. According to the Commission on
   Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change (CSACC), more than
   30 million acres of agricultural land are degraded each year
   due to overgrazing and other poor agricultural practices,
   climate change, groundwater depletion, urban sprawl, and
   additional human activities.

   Cropland degradation, however, is not the only way in which
   current practices are overtaxing the planet. According to Jahn,
   the historic focus of research and intensive inputs on
   maximizing crop yield has obscured the extent and vulnerability
   of globalized and regionalized food delivery systems: large
   parts of the world no longer do—and presumably no longer
   can—feed themselves. Crop failures or food system
   interruptions, especially due to multiple major events in a
   single annual growing cycle in either North or South America,
   could bring large parts of Europe and Asia to the brink of
   starvation (see Figure 1). Interruption of ocean transport, a
   cyber disaster, or major telecommunication networks could do
   the same. How great, one wonders, are the risks of such
   disasters?

   Food security is inalterably connected to other forms of
   security, including energy, water, physical (infrastructure),
   environmental, economic, and human (personal) security. New
   intelligence paradigms involving multiscale tools that
   distinguish between, for instance, slow and fast-moving trends
   are altering our understanding of these interconnections and
   the way that shocks propagate through the system.

   The CSACC has issued a series of seven recommendations for
   achieving global food security. Some are fairly predictable,
   including #2: Significantly raise the level of global
   investment in sustainable agriculture and food systems in the
   next decade, and #4: Develop specific programmes and policies
   to assist populations and sectors that are most vulnerable to
   climate changes and food insecurity. However, Jahn focused on
   the last one, recommendation #7: Create comprehensive, shared,
   integrated information systems that encompass human and
   ecological dimensions [of agricultural and food systems].

   Why, she asked, does this recommendation deserve special
   attention? To answer this question, Jahn presented two maps of
   India with brightly colored areas indicating irrigated lands.
   One map showed some 279 million acres of irrigated land, while
   the other displayed little more than half as many. Jahn said
   that the representations were from two mainstream institutions
   in the country, reinforcing the limitations of such
   visualizations. Which figure should be included in an
   integrated information system intended to inform the policy
   process?

   Integrated (and interactive) near-real-time information systems
   already exist. Figure 2 shows the homepage of one such system,
   which can track production sites, transport vessels, weather
   conditions, infrastructure, and more. Yet it reflects only
   currently-available data, including dubious estimates of many
   important quantities and no estimates at all of some others.

   Information concerning the demand for food is particularly
   fragmented and incomplete. Ultimately, displays like the one in
   Figure 2 will depict the flow of energy, including that of
   human beings, from place to place. Current available
   representations, however, fail to portray energy flows with
   sufficient clarity. Might it one day be possible to produce a
   dynamic and comprehensive display—akin to a weather map—of
   energy flows throughout the global food delivery system, with
   an indication of the level of uncertainty?

   weather conditions, and infrastructure. Image credit: Thomson
   Reuters Eikon.

   As matters stand, the world has a severely incomplete
   understanding of risks that could result in food system
   instability or breakdown. A number of unconventional
   partnerships have recently formed to address the issue – by
   assembling trustworthy bodies of information suitable for
   planning purposes and making them available to the public. Jahn
   spoke of a nascent collaboration between Oak Ridge National
   Laboratory and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement
   Center (better known by its Spanish acronym, CIMMYT), aided by
   Thomson Reuters’ platform Eikon and the Multi-Agency
   Collaboration Environment. She also mentioned the work of a
   group of insurance practitioners, who convened at Lloyd’s of
   London in 2015 to assess the cascade of impacts that could
   result from a plausible scenario (developed by the Jahn
   Research Group of UW-Madison, in conjunction with the U.K./U.S.
   Task Force on Resilience of the Global Food Supply Chain to
   Extreme Events) of a shock to the worldwide production of
   certain staple food crops. The group concluded that food
   insecurity will be among the largest risks to global society
   over the next ten years, and that climate change will be one of
   the most important supply-side drivers of that insecurity. They
   quantified the economic impact of the shock in question as
   follows: U.S. stocks lose 5% of their value, E.U. stocks lose
   19% of their value, global rice production falls 7%, maize
   production falls 10%, soybean production falls 11%, and rice
   prices rise 500%.

   These and related factors create both risk and opportunity for
   certain types of businesses. For example, food and beverage
   companies are painfully exposed to supply risks, which have
   grown with the extension of their supply chains. To reduce such
   risks, certain features of the global food delivery system will
   need to change. Global conditions will force governments to
   prohibit some currently-profitable activities, such as the
   depletion of fossil water reserves in the mighty (but
   non-regenerating) Ogallala Aquifer to grow grain for sale in
   Southeast Asia. In so doing, they will incur the wrath of those
   whose profits diminish, in league with a swarm of supply-side
   economists.

   Mathematicians can help improve global food security by
   familiarizing themselves with economic models other than the
   “supply-side” model so favored by the Ronald Reagan
   administration. It differs in name only from the long-dominant
   “neoclassical model” of economic behavior. Jahn quoted Ha-Joon
   Chang, a gadfly in the economics profession, whose book [1]
   furnishes an eminently readable (if somewhat incomplete) guide
   to alternative schools of economic thought. Because the
   dominant model favors inaction in almost every circumstance,
   mathematicians can hasten Jahn’s “needed change” by
   contributing to the development of more reliable economic
   models. Yet the incorporation of unfamiliar models in the
   policy process will likely take decades.


   A quicker way for mathematicians to enter the fray against food
   insecurity is by improving the quality and utility of available
   information through enhanced data mining techniques, the
   resolution of conflicting data, and interpolation where gaps
   occur. Though a great deal of information is already being
   collected in or near real time, much of it is fragmented and
   disorganized, possibly delaying recognition of credible
   threats. Even small contributions to the campaign against food
   insecurity could significantly impact human wellbeing.^1
