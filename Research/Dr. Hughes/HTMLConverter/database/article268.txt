   Unique scientific visualizations from researchers and the
   public are now being accepted for the 2017 Vizzies challenge,
   the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Popular Science
   magazine announced today.

   The competition, in its 15th year, recognizes the finest
   science and engineering-themed illustrations, photographs,
   videos, graphics and interactive displays, whether produced by
   academic researchers, artists or hobbyists. All submissions are
   eligible to win in both the Experts' Choice and People's Choice
   categories.

   To recognize and encourage visualization in communicating
   science, and to showcase the exceptional talents of those who
   work in this area, NSF and Science magazine cosponsored the
   first annual Science and Engineering Visualization Challenge in
   2003. NSF and Popular Science launched their new partnership as
   co-sponsors in 2014.

   The Vizzies uses visualizations to express the ideas of
   scientists and engineers in new and powerful ways. In the
   contest’s early years, participants sent in submissions by
   mail, which meant packages of all shapes and sizes containing
   sculptures, board games, physical posters, artists’ drawings,
   paintings and more. Today, participants are encouraged to
   review the challenge rules and submit their entries to the
   Vizzies’ online submission system found on the [95]Vizzies
   website.


   A panel of experts in scientific visualizations appointed by
   NSF and Popular Science will select one Experts' Choice winner
   per category in each of five categories: Photography,
   Illustration, Posters & Graphics, Interactives and Video.
   Public votes will determine People's Choice winners.

   The judging criteria includes:
       scientific insight, is visually striking and conveys the
       artist's skill and expertise in the chosen medium. It
       conveys the artist's mastery of the fundamentals and
       principles of design, and is executed with factual
       accuracy.
       clearly and understandably. It uses plain language -- both
       written and spoken -- in the entry itself and its
       accompanying text. An entry also must convey science,
       technology, engineering or mathematics principles.
       individual voice, vitality and energy; creates a novel
       presentation or tells a compelling story; and portrays new
       scientific insight and methods.

   To learn more about the competition -- including rules and
   regulations -- and submit your scientific visualization, visit
   the [96]Vizzies website.

   The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal
   agency that supports fundamental research and education across
   all fields of science and engineering. In fiscal year (FY)
   2017, its budget is $7.5 billion. NSF funds reach all 50 states
   through grants to nearly 2,000 colleges, universities and other
   institutions. Each year, NSF receives more than 48,000
   competitive proposals for funding and makes about 12,000 new
   funding awards.
