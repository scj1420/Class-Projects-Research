   Scientists at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security,
   Reliability and Trust (SnT) of the University of Luxembourg
   have developed an important mathematical algorithm called
   "Equihash". Equihash is a core component for the new
   cryptocurrency Zcash, which offers more privacy and equality
   than the famous Bitcoin. Zcash came into operation as an
   experimental technology for a community-driven digital currency
   in late 2016.

   Bitcoin is by far the most recognized and widely used digital
   currency. It was introduced in January 2009 and has garnered
   much attention since then. But it is not the only one of its
   kind. Wikipedia lists nearly one hundred cryptocurrencies
   boasting more than 1 million US dollar market capitalisation.

   One of the newest cryptocurrencies is "Zcash", which can be
   seen as an update to the Bitcoin protocols. In Bitcoin, the
   transfer of coins is recorded in a global ledger, the so-called
   blockchain. The validity of the latest transfers in the
   blockchain is verified about every ten minutes. Verifying the
   transfers and creating new blocks for the blockchain (the
   so-called mining) requires a lot of computing power, which is
   provided by distributed computers worldwide. The "miners" who
   allocate the processing power are rewarded with new coins.

   Zcash is trying to resolve two main shortcomings of Bitcoin:
   its lack of privacy for transactions and the centralization of
   transaction verification into the hands of a mere dozen miners
   who have invested in large amounts of specialized mining
   hardware: Bitcoin is prone to such centralization because the
   computational load of the bitcoin mining algorithm can be split
   into many different small tasks, which can be conducted in
   parallel. The algorithm is easy to implement in dedicated,
   energy-efficient and cheap microchips, but not suited to
   standard hardware. Bitcoin mining today is therefore done on
   special-purpose supercomputers which are located in places with
   cheap electricity and/or cheap cooling. Such supercomputers are
   expensive, costing millions of euros, but provide much more
   mining power than if one were to use standard PC hardware of
   the same price.

   Prof. Alex Biryukov, head of the research group "Cryptolux" and
   Dr. Dmitry Khovratovich at SnT have developed the algorithm
   "Equihash" which can resolve this problem. Equihash is a so
   called memory-hard problem, which can not be split up into
   smaller working packages. It can be more efficiently calculated
   on desktop-class computers with their multiple processing cores
   and gigabytes of memory than on special hardware chips. "If
   10.000 miners with a single PC were active, in Zcash the
   investment to compete with them would be 10.000 times the price
   of a PC, while with bitcoin, the investment would be
   significantly smaller", says Khovratovich. This creates a more
   democratic digital currency by allowing more users to
   contribute to the mining process. Khovratovich adds: "The
   strength of a cryptocurrency comes from the fact that the
   ledger is globally distributed. Our Equihash algorithm reverses
   the situation back to this more ideal world."

   Equihash was first presented at the Network and Distributed
   System Security Symposium last year - one of the top-5 IT
   security events. Prof. Biryukov comments: "Since Equihash is
   based on a fundamental computer science problem, advances in
   Equihash mining algorithms will benefit computer science in
   general. Equihash is so far unique among all the mining
   algorithms: it is memory-hard on the one hand and very easy to
   verify on the other." In other words, while mining new coins
   with Zcash/Equihash is comparatively expensive, hence posing a
   smaller risk of monopolization because it requires large
   amounts of computer memory and hard computational work,
   checking that the new coins are genuine is memoryless, fast and
   cheap.

   Understanding these advantages, the creators of Zcash chose
   Equihash as the algorithm for mining coins and verifying
   transfers. Equihash itself is not limited to use in Zcash and
   can be used in any cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin.

   "With our contribution to Zcash, the Cryptography and Security
   lab (CryptoLux) has shown its strength in innovative research
   that has immediate applications in the financial technology
   industry," says SnT´s director, Prof. Björn Ottersten. "We
   invite students to follow us in this promising field," adds
   Professor Biryukov: "There are still lots of challenging
   research problems to solve."
