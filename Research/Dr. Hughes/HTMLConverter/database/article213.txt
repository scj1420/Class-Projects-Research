[44]Cat feasts on seafood worth $1,100 at Russian airport


   “It was decided to continue the cat’s education, to help him
   master more complicated math problems - subtraction,
   multiplication, division. Then, it became obvious that the cat
   is much smarter than previously thought. Perhaps, he is the
   world’s only can that knows how to count,” employees say.

   Cats have had a long history of taking up residence at the
   museum, as far back as Peter the Great bringing the first
   palace feline from Holland. Later on, his daughter Empress
   Elizabeth would publish a decree to send rat-catching cats to
   the Winter Palace from Kazan. In 1764, Catherine II granted the
   cats official museum guard status, when the Hermitage opened.
   During the Siege of Leningrad, the Hermitage cats were
   protected, because they kept the rats away from the
   collections.

   In 2015, British media recognized the Hermitage cats as one of
   the world’s most unusual sights.
