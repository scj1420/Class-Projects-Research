   On-air challenge: Given two kinds of people or things, name
   something they both do — in three letters.

   For example: a false witness, and a person in bed —> lie.

   Last week's challenge, from listener Peter Weisz of West Palm
   Beach, Fla.: Name something in 11 letters that's a common
   household item. You can rearrange the first six letters to form
   a synonym of a word spelled by the middle three letters. What
   is the item, and what are the words?

   Answer: Thermometer; mother, mom.

   Winner: Jeff Vorchheimer of Summit, N.J.

   Next week's challenge, from Mike Hinterberg of Loveland, Colo.:
   Name a creature in nine letters. The name contains a T. Drop
   the T, and the remaining letters can be rearranged to spell two
   related modes of transportation. What are they?
