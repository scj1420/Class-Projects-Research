   Welcome to Week 12 of the Wednesday Morning Math Challenge. You
   can find solutions [12]to the Week 11 puzzles here, along with
   — more importantly — discussions of some ways to approach them.
   Remember that the real goal here is to think creatively.


   This week, we’re going to look at one problem — but it’s a hard
   one.
     __________________________________________________________

   Consider the set of integers: 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, …

   Even though it’s infinite, this set is considered countable,
   because we can count them. You could do it on your fingers!
   You’d have to go on forever, but you could do it without
   skipping anything.

   Now consider the set of numbers between 0 and 1. Are those
   numbers countable? How do you know?
