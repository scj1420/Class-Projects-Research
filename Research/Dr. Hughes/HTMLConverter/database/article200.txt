   As part of the observance of Chicagoland Engineers Week,
   February 21-27, 2016, professional engineers, engineering
   societies, major corporations, CEO’s, and civic leaders will
   attend the Washington Award Benefit on Friday evening, February
   26th at the Chicago Hilton and Towers, 720 S. Michigan,
   Chicago.  The Washington Award reminds us that our first

   comfort and well-being of humanity.”  Dr. Aprille Ericsson,
   Aerospace Engineer. NASA Gouda Space Flight Center will be this
   year’s 103rd recipient of the Washington Award.    She was the
   first female, and the first African-American female, to receive
   a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from Howard University and
   the first African-American female to receive a Ph.D. in
   engineering at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.



   In addition, nearly 100 students (3^rd grade through high
   school) will be honored to recognize their accomplishments in a
   variety of science, technology, engineering and mathematics
   (S.T.E.M.) program competitions (Future City Competition,
   Bridge Building Contest, FIRST Robotics Competition,
   Essay/Poster Contest, Illinois Science Fair and Destination
