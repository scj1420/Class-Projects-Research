   Elemens des mathematiques was a popular text for the teaching
   of mathematics in French schools during the 17^th century.
   Abraham de Moivre studied from it as a student. Little is known
   of its author, [308]Jean Prestet, other than that he was a
   Catholic priest. This is the title page for the 1675 first
   printing.

   A foldout table provides: multiplication and division facts,
   powers of the basic numbers through powers of \(10,\) and
   listings of coefficients for the binominal expansion of
   \((a+b).\)
