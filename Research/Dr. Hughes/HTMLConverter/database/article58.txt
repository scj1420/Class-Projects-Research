   Christian’s put together this fun applet for exploring the Zeta
   function – you can move your pointer around to reveal the value
   of $\zeta$ at each point in the complex plane.

   The hue (colour) revealed is the argument of the value, and the
   lightness (bright to dark) represents the magnitude. There’s a
   [41]blog post over at Gandhi Viswanathan’s Blog explaining how
   it works.


   The resulting plot has contour lines showing how the function
   behaves.
