   Inside Science Minds presents an ongoing series of guest
   columnists and personal perspectives presented by scientists,
   engineers, mathematicians, and others in the science community
   showcasing some of the most interesting ideas in science
   today. The opinions contained in this piece are those of the
   authors and do not necessarily reflect those of Inside Science

   (Inside Science Minds) -- We recently met with a host of
   biotechnology leaders and were struck by their infatuation with
   Big Data and machine learning. In fact, upon reflection, it was
   amazing how often the word "algorithm" came up in the course of
   our conversations with these accomplished scientists.

   Don't get us wrong. The boom in software and computing has
   achieved powerful and profound results in our society. And,
   yes, the world is a better place, thanks to data analytics.

   But we need to slow down and regain our perspective, because
   Big Data and machine learning are absolutely not ends unto
   themselves, and they certainly aren't a replacement for basic
   scientific research and exploration.

   Part of the issue is that Big Data and machine learning make
   scientific problem-solving look easy -- and, sometimes, even
   magical. This appeals to our need for instant gratification in
   an impatient world that, too often, seems to view apps, rather
   than test tubes, as the smoothest and best way to achieve
   progress.

   But this is a misconception that distorts our expectations and
   allows people to draw conclusions that aren't supported by
   evidence. Even worse, the current love affair with Big Data and
   machine learning, which simply identifies patterns, propagates
   a false perception that scientific rigor isn't really required
   and human knowledge isn't really relevant.

   So, if there are any doubts, we want to say it loud and say it
   proud -- science is (and must remain) alive and well. The hard,
   laborious and painstaking work in the lab has to continue so
   that we can understand how nature operates; so that we can
   discover and expand into new knowledge areas; so that we can
   keep asking "Why" during the scientific inquiry and
   experimentation process; and so that we can build new systems
   models that are needed to address and confront some of the most
   critical issues that people on just about every continent
   currently face.

   The career implications here are quite evident. It's much
   easier to gain access to a computer, generate large amounts of
   data and then build an algorithm as opposed to hunkering down
   in the lab over an extended period of time, asking probing
   questions, developing hypotheses and testing those
   suppositions.

   It could also be argued that the appeal and attraction of Big
   Data and machine learning has engendered complacency. Sure,
   algorithms generate lots of quick hits; but we have to ask
   about the depth and richness of these insights, and whether the
   flood of patterns they're based on actually obstructs our
   underlying knowledge. Put another way, Big Data and machine
   learning offer up correlations and matches while science tries
   to deal in causality and mechanistic underpinnings.

   We're not arguing in either/or terms. Indeed, in a more
   perfect world, we'd see a greater blend and balance between Big
   Data, machine learning and science. That means taking patterns
   and hypotheses about cause and effect and designing thoughtful,
   statistically powered, and fully dimensional experiments that
   test for the natural truth.

   Part of the solution here is cross-disciplinary training, so
   that data experts can better understand scientists and vice
   versa. And, in terms of curriculum, we also need a co-mingling
   of disciplines in order to achieve the best knowledge outcomes.

   The key question is what happens if we don't find the right
   blend and balance between Big Data, machine learning and solid
   scientific study and discovery. First, we'll probably see a
   growing number of talented but frustrated scientists, which
   doesn't bode well for our innovative future; we could see
   funding for basic science soften; for its part, Big Data will
   miss out on a chance to play a truly meaningful role in
   society's problem-solving process; and, perhaps most
   importantly, the hard science of building and breaking things
   in the name of knowledge and well-being will be significantly
   diminished.

   The bottom line is that we can't afford to let Big Data and
   machine learning eclipse science; and, on the other side of the
   fence, science canâ€™t afford to shun Big Data and machine
   learning if it wants to continue solving the toughest problems
   for this generation and the ones that will follow.

   At the end of the day, we need to keep in mind that some of
   these problems are so intricate and tangled that we'll need
   healthy doses of both observation and evidence in order to
   unravel them. We must also remember that correlation does not
   imply causality, and causality is necessary to get at
   mechanistic underpinnings of a problem upon which solutions can
   be built. And, finally, let's not lose sight of the fact that
   machine learning finds patterns and looks at the "what." But it
   does not examine the "why," which represents critical knowledge
   in an age of growing complexity and confusion.
