   “Ever since the dawn of civilization,” Stephen Hawking wrote in
   his international bestseller A Brief History of Time, “people
   have not been content to see events as unconnected and
   inexplicable. They have craved an understanding of the
   underlying order in the world.”

   In the quest for a unified, coherent description of all of
   nature — a “theory of everything” — physicists have unearthed
   the taproots linking ever more disparate phenomena. With the
   law of universal gravitation, Isaac Newton wedded the fall of
   an apple to the orbits of the planets. Albert Einstein, in his
   theory of relativity, wove space and time into a single fabric,
   and showed how apples and planets fall along the fabric’s
   curves. And today, all known elementary particles plug neatly
   into a mathematical structure called the Standard Model. But
   our physical theories remain riddled with disunions, holes and
   inconsistencies. These are the deep questions that must be
   answered in pursuit of the theory of everything.

   Our map of the frontier of fundamental physics, built by the
   interactive developer Emily Fuhrman, weights questions roughly
   according to their importance in advancing the field. It seemed
   natural to give greatest weight to the quest for a theory of
   quantum gravity, which would encompass general relativity and
   quantum mechanics in a single framework. In their day-to-day
   work, though, many physicists focus more on rooting out dark
   matter, solving the Standard Model’s hierarchy problem, and
   pondering the goings-on in black holes, those mysterious
   swallowers of space and time. For each question, the map
   presents several proposed solutions. Relationships between
   these proposals form a network of ideas.

   The map provides concise descriptions of highly complex
   theories; learn more by exploring the links to dozens of
   articles and videos, and vote for the ideas you find most
   elegant or promising. Finally, the map is extensive, but hardly
   exhaustive; proposed additions are welcome below.
