   This book is one of the best examples of the phrase “Never
   judge a book by its cover” that I have ever seen. The image on
   the front cover is of an elderly woman in drab clothing that is
   very out of focus. It is impossible to determine if she is
   actually Emmy Noether. She is standing by a bench and in front
   of either a street or railway car. I do not understand why such
   a poor image was selected for the front cover. I did a quick
   Internet search and found several pictures of Noether that
   would have been far more appropriate. Given that Noether died
   at the age of 53, it is also unlikely that the image is even of
   her.

   That rant aside, this book is an excellent biography of the
   premier female mathematician of the twentieth century. As seems
   necessary when writing for young people, the author engages in
   a great deal of “literary creativity” in generating the
   supposed dialog between Emmy and her parents, siblings,
   students and coworkers. None of it is beyond the bounds of
   plausible conversation and she is presented as a woman of
   substance who cared little for the trappings of style and pomp.
   Everything but her mathematics and the strength of her opinions
   was plain: her looks, physique, clothing and diet were all
   necessary incidentals in her life.

   Noether was also a pioneer in the role of women in mathematics;
   she overcame her gender early and then her ethnicity later when
   the Nazis rose to power in Germany. While she had powerful
   mathematical friends, it still took determination and
   perseverance for her to get her degree and a position in
   academia. All women in mathematics and science owe her a debt
   for what she accomplished.

   Although this book has the obvious target of the teenage female
   reader, the effective target is much broader. Young males also
   need to learn how what is now called the glass ceiling for
   women used to be made of plate steel and was much lower. Older
   established females need to be reminded on occasion about the
   women who came before them and used their talent as virtual
   cutting torches to cut the barriers away.
