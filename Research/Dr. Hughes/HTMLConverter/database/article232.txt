   Joint review of


   If you’re not familiar with the important work that Professor
   Wu has done in elementary mathematics education in the past
   decade or so, this quote from the preface to Teaching School
   Mathematics: Pre-Algebra might be a bit jarring:

     These two volumes are designed not to show you how
     mathematics is really just common sense and lots of fun, but
     to help you teach the mathematics of middle school in a way
     that meets the minimal standards of human communication.

   With that sentence, the tone is set: there is a serious
   dimension to these books that is often not present in standard
   “mathematics for teachers” textbooks. This is a challenge faced
   by some of us who teach these classes: are we doing “serious”
   mathematics? This series doesn’t bother with the typical
   chapters on problem solving and elementary set theory that are
   very much the norm in books for this course, but strikes a blow
   for serious work by diving right into fractions.

   “Serious work” is repeatedly contrasted here with TSM, or
   “textbook school mathematics”, which is cited as a source of
   mathematical errors and a barrier to maintaining mathematical
   integrity in the K–8 curriculum. As an example, TSM’s treatment
   of the laws of exponents is cited in the Algebra volume as
   possibly the best example of how traditional practices
   interfere with five fundamental principles of mathematics:
    1. Precise definitions are essential.
    2. Every statement must be supported by reasoning.
    3. Mathematical statements are precise.
    4. Mathematics is coherent.
    5. Mathematics is purposeful.

   While no working mathematician would be likely to argue with
   these ideas, to see them at the forefront of a textbook at this
   level is at once refreshing in its forthrightness and striking
   in its novelty. We need books for future teachers that take
   this approach to our subject.

   In my 15 or so years teaching Mathematics for Elementary
   Teachers, I have repeatedly tried to sell it to students by
   asserting that there’s a lot of depth behind what looks to the
   casual observer as fairly simple mathematics. That doesn’t
   always work — my college requires minimal mathematics from all
   of its students, not just prospective teachers, which
   diminishes the receptiveness of the target audience — but it
   doesn’t mean that I’ll stop trying. This pair of books has
   great potential to assist all of us who struggle in that quest.
   It may be quite a while before my students are ready to learn
   directly from these books, but I’m finding elements of Wu’s
   arguments that make their way into my classroom right now.

   (Forest dot, 2002) who has taught both English composition and
   organic chemistry to college students has not, to his
   knowledge, been successfully contradicted. If it ever is, he is
   sure that his experience teaching introductory geology will
   break the deadlock.
