   Imagine the most extreme stereotypes about computer scientists:
   They're socially awkward indoor kids. They have an obsessive
   focus on technology and a closet full of rumpled hoodies.

   They're male.

   Cultural perceptions about who is a computer scientist — or an
   engineer or a physicist — are a big reason why women are still
   underrepresented in certain science, engineering, technology
   and mathematics (STEM) fields, according to researchers at the
   University of Washington in Seattle.

   "The assumptions about what it takes to be a good computer
   scientist or engineer are very narrow," said Sapna Cheryan, a
   UW psychology professor and lead author of [53]a study
   published this week in the journal Psychological Bulletin.

   "If you have narrow stereotypes, then it's going to end up
   attracting a more narrow band of people, including a narrow
   band of men," she told Mashable.

   Cheryan said her research team wanted to understand why some
   STEM fields had made progress in closing the gender gap, while
   others remained largely dominated by men.

   The researchers analyzed more than 1,200 papers on the topic,
   with a particular focus on the six STEM fields with the most
   undergraduate degrees: biology, chemistry and math — which have
   the highest share of female participation — and computer
   science, engineering and physics, which have the widest gender
   gaps.

   "People talk about women's underrepresentation in STEM overall,
   but if you look at the data, it's really more complicated than
   that," Cheryan said.

   For instance, women earn more than half of U.S. undergraduate
   degrees in biology, chemistry and math, the National Science
   Foundation found in a [55]2014 study. Yet women earn less than
   20 percent of degrees in computer science, engineering and
   physics.


   The UW literature review adds to a growing public debate about
   how schools and companies can encourage more women to pursue
   STEM fields — while also ensuring women have equal
   opportunities as men to hold leadership positions and advance
   their research.

   The study also comes as the scientific community is slowly
   opening up about the sexual harassment and abuse that has long
   plagued male-dominated fields, particularly [56]astronomy.


   Mashable [57]previously reported that the rise of blogs and
   other digital outlets are making it easier for women to
   communicate more efficiently and powerfully about their
   experiences with everything from demeaning remarks and
   inappropriate comments to unwanted sexual conduct.




   Cheryan and her research team did not address sexual harassment
   in their Oct. 12 study, but they did identify the "masculine
   culture" as one of three key reasons why women are discouraged
   from participating in computer science, engineering and
   physics.

   Stereotypes about "brogrammers" and computer geeks fall under
   this umbrella, as do beliefs that women simply aren't as good
   as men in these fields. A relative lack of female leaders in
   the fields, and a dearth of pop culture icons to serve as role
   models, help to reinforce these oversimplified and inaccurate
   ideas.

   "These assumptions about the fields signal to men that they
   belong, more than it signals to women they belong there,"
   Cheryan said in an interview.

   Jen Goldbeck, a computer scientist and professor at the
   University of Maryland, said in her own experience, this
   masculine environment helps to foster doubt about women's
   abilities or intelligence.

   "Because there are so few of us, if one woman struggles with
   something or makes a mistake, some guys will presume that all
   women are like that (even if there are guys who struggle
   more)," she told Mashable in an email.

   She shared the following XKCD [59]webcomic, which she said
   speaks to life as a female computer scientist.

   "On top of that, many men in CS [computer science] don't think
   there is a problem; they think we make things up, read too much
   into derogatory comments ("it has nothing to do with gender"),
   or are oversensitive," Goldbeck added.

   "That means no one will tell the offenders to knock it off, and
   there aren't a lot of female faculty to turn to."

   "It can be a really exhausting experience, so a lot of smart,
   talented women find themselves more welcome in math or
   biology," she said.

     People can only change so much, especially when their
     society is constraining them

   The UW study also found that certain STEM fields have a wider
   gender gap because of students' inexperience in those subjects
   prior to entering college.

   Fewer U.S. high school students have experience in computer
   science, engineering or physics prior to college, which means
   they largely rely on those masculine stereotypes to shape their
   understandings of the field.

   "If the culture is masculine, and telling you the people who
   would be good at these fields are men, it will be harder for
   you to even put that on the table," Cheryan said.

   When it comes to biology, chemistry and math, however, most
   high schoolers are required to take courses in those areas,
   giving students an earlier experience of diversity in those
   fields.



   The third reason for the lopsided gender gap, according to the
   UW study, is that women generally tend to underestimate their
   abilities in computer science, engineering and physics.

   Men, on the other hand, tend to overestimate their skills.

   Nilanjana Dasgupta, a professor of psychological and brain
   sciences at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, has
   explored this confidence gap in her own research.

   In one study, Dasgupta and her colleagues followed 15
   entry-level calculus classes during a semester, with seven
   classes taught by a female professor.

   They found that women outperformed men across the board in
   their final grades. But female students were less confident
   they would get a good grade, and showed less interest in the
   class, if their professor was male. Male students were less
   influenced by their professor's gender.

   "Clearly the ability is not the issue," Dasgupta [62]said in a
   campus talk in April that was covered by the Daily Collegian.
   "Confidence is the issue." Dasgupta was not involved in the new
   research.




   Cheryan said the UW research shows the need to develop a more
   inclusive culture in STEM fields, whether by developing
   "subcultures" that make girls feel they belong or working with
   professors and students to counteract negative stereotypes
   about women's abilities.

   The UW professor said this approach differed from the ongoing
   attempts to simply stoke women's interest in STEM and draw them
   into computer sciences or engineering.

   "People can only change so much, especially when their society
   is constraining them," she said.

   "Rather than making women change, it's more fair and just and
   better for the field if they have more welcoming cultures."
