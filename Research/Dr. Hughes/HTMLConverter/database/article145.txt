   mystery”

   I’ve been [36]writing a lot lately about consciousness, the
   ultimate enigma. I used to think why there is something rather
   than nothing is the ultimate enigma. But without mind, there
   might as well be nothing.


   Some mind-ponderers, notably philosopher Colin McGinn, argue
   that consciousness is unsolvable. Philosopher Owen Flanagan
   calls these pessimists “mysterians,” after the 60’s-era rock
   group “Question Mark and the Mysterians.”

   Recently, physicist Edward Witten came out as a mysterian.
   Witten is regarded with awe by his fellow physicists, some of
   whom have compared him to Einstein and Newton. He is largely
   responsible for the popularity of string theory over the past
   several decades. String theory holds that all of nature's
   forces stem from infinitesimal particles wriggling in a
   hyperspace consisting of many extra dimensions.

   Witten is optimistic about science’s power to solve mysteries,
   such as why there is something rather than nothing. [37]In a
   2014 Q&A with me he said: “The modern scientific endeavor has
   been going on for hundreds of years by now, and we've gotten
   way farther than our predecessors probably imagined.” He also
   reaffirmed his belief that string theory will turn out to be
   “right.”


   [38]But in a fascinating video interview with journalist Wim
   Kayzer, Witten is pessimistic about the prospects for a
   scientific explanation of consciousness. The chemist Ash
   Jogalekar, who blogs as “The Curious Wavefunction,” [39]wrote
   about Witten’s speech and transcribed the relevant section.
   (Thanks, Ash.) Here is an excerpt:


   I think consciousness will remain a mystery. Yes, that's what I
   tend to believe. I tend to think that the workings of the
   conscious brain will be elucidated to a large extent.
   Biologists and perhaps physicists will understand much better
   how the brain works. But why something that we call
   consciousness goes with those workings, I think that will
   remain mysterious. I have a much easier time imagining how we
   understand the Big Bang than I have imagining how we can
   understand consciousness...

   Just because Witten is a genius does not mean he is infallible.
   He is wrong, I believe, that string theory will eventually be
   validated, and he could be wrong that consciousness will never
   be explained. I nonetheless find it newsworthy—and
   refreshing--that a scientist of his caliber is talking so
   candidly about the limits of science. For [40]reasons that are
   perhaps too obvious, I like Ash Jogalekar’s take on Witten’s
   comments. An excerpt:


   It's interesting to contrast Witten's thoughts with John
   Horgan's E[41]nd of Science thesis… The end of science really
   is the end of the search for final causation. In that sense not
   just consciousness but many aspects of the world may always
   remain a mystery. Whether that is emotionally pleasing or
   disconcerting is an individual choice that each one of us has
   to make.
