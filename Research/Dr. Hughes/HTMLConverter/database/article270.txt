Mathematical Treasure: Daniel Bernoulli’s Hydrodynamica

   [308]Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782), a member of the famous Swiss
   family of mathematicians and scientists, was noted himself as
   an accomplished mathematician and physicist. His Hydrodynamica,
   published in 1738, is considered his most important work. As
   its name implies, the book described the mechanics of moving
   water. Applying the principles of mechanics and observing the
   conservation of energy, Bernoulli also derived the basic laws
   for the behavior of gases. Mathematics was now becoming an
   “applied” discipline.


   The illustration on Bernoulli's first page of text (below)
   depicts devices dependent on the power of flowing water. Can
   you identify them together with their usage?

   These images are supplied through the cooperation of The
   Treasures of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) Library Collection. The individual images
   were photographed by Mr. Sean Linehan.
