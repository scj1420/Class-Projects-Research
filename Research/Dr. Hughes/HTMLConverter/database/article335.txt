   The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal
   agency that supports fundamental research and education across
   all fields of science and engineering. In fiscal year (FY)
   2017, its budget is $7.5 billion. NSF funds reach all 50 states
   through grants to nearly 2,000 colleges, universities and other
   institutions. Each year, NSF receives more than 48,000
   competitive proposals for funding and makes about 12,000 new
   funding awards.
