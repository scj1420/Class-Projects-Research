Native RPC access in Python

   The "official" way in Apache Hadoop to connect natively to HDFS
   from a C-friendly language like Python is to use [15]libhdfs, a
   JNI-based C wrapper for the HDFS Java client. A primary benefit
   of libhdfs is that it is distributed and supported by major
   Hadoop vendors, and it's a part of the Apache Hadoop project. A
   downside is that it uses JNI (spawning a JVM within a Python
   process) and requires a complete Hadoop Java distribution on
   the client side. Some clients find this unpalatable and don't
   necessarily require the production-level support that other
   applications require. For example, Apache Impala (incubating),
   a C++ application, uses libhdfs to access data in HDFS.


   Due to the heavier-weight nature of libhdfs, alternate native
   interfaces to HDFS have been developed.
       C++ library developed by Pivotal Labs for use in the HAWQ
       SQL-on-Hadoop system. Conveniently, libhdfs3 is very nearly
       interchangeable for libhdfs at the C API level. At one time
       it seemed that libhdfs3 might become a part of Apache
       Hadoop officially, but that does not now seem likely (see
       [17]HDFS-8707, a new C++ client in development).

   Since snakebite does not offer a comprehensive client API (e.g.
   it cannot write files) and has worse performance (being
   implemented in pure Python), I'll focus on libhdfs and libhdfs3
   going forward.
