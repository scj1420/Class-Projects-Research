   On-air challenge: Every answer this week is a pun on a
   well-known food brand at a grocery or supermarket.

   For example: given the prompt "tiny golf pegs," the right
   answer is "Wheaties." (Get it? "Wee tees.")

   Last week's challenge: Take the words DOES, TOES and SHOES.
   They all end in the same three letters, but none of them rhyme.
   What words starting with F, S and G have the same property? The
   F and S words are four letters long, and the G word is five
   letters. They all end in the same three letters.

   Answer: Foul, Soul, Ghoul.

   Winner: John Leatherman.

   Next week's challenge, from Lowell Beineke of Fort Wayne, Ind.:
   Name an 11-letter occupation starting with H. If you have the
   right one, you can rearrange the letters to name two things a
   worker with this occupation uses — one in six letters and one
   in five. What occupation is it?
