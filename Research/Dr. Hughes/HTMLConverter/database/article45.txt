Natural transformations

   Posted on [23]16 March 2017 by [24]John


   The ladder of abstractions in category theory starts with
   categories, then functors, then natural transformations.
   Unfortunately, natural transformations don’t seem very natural
   when you first see the definition. This is ironic since the
   original motivation for developing category theory was to
   formalize the intuitive notion of a transformation being
   “natural.” Historically, functors were defined in order to
   define natural transformations, and categories were defined in
   order to define functors, just the opposite of the order in
   which they are introduced now.

   A category is a collection of objects and arrows between
   objects. Usually these “arrows” are functions, but in general
   they don’t have to be.

   A functor maps a category to another category. Since a category
   consists of objects and arrows, a functor maps objects to
   objects and arrows to arrows.

   A natural transformation maps functors to functors. Sounds
   reasonable, but what does that mean?

   You can think of a functor as a way to create a picture of one
   category inside another. Suppose you have some category and
   pick out two objects in that category, A and B, and suppose
   there is an arrow f between A and B. Then a functor F would
   take A and B and give you objects FA and FB in another
   category, and an arrow Ff between FA and FB. You could do the
   same with another functor G. So the objects A and B and the
   arrow between them in the first category have counterparts
   under the functors F and G in the new category as in the two
   diagrams below.

   A natural transformation α between F and G is something that
   connects these two diagrams into one diagram that commutes.

   The natural transformation α is a collection of arrows in the
   new category, one for every object in the original category. So
   we have an arrow α[A] for the object A and another arrow α[B]
   for the object B. These arrows are called the components of α
   at A and B respectively.

   Note that the components of α depend on the objects A and B but
   not on the arrow f. If f represents any other arrow from A to B
   in the original category, the same arrows α[A] and α[B] fill in
   the diagram.

   Natural transformations are meant to capture the idea that a
   transformation is “natural” in the sense of not depending on
   any arbitrary choices. If a transformation does depend on
   arbitrary choices, the arrows α[A] and α[B] would not be
   reusable but would have to change when f changes.

   The [25]next post will discuss the canonical examples of
   natural and unnatural transformations.
