       For any e>0 there exists an N>0 such than m,n> N ==>
       |a_n-a_m|<e, that would be Cauchy.

       For all of you who love a numbers person, here are your
       Valentines ❤
       ps – yes, I majored in one of these fields, and worked on a
       masters in another one of them, so this struck all of my
       funny bones 😀
