   Tackling intractable computing problems

   Theoretical computer science project helps solve long-standing
   questions with benefits for security and machine learning

                    theoretical computer science

   Researchers hope to develop machine learning algorithms with
   provable guarantees.

   June 29, 2016

   Computers have proven capable of helping scientists solve many
   research problems, from the dynamics of black hole mergers to
   distant connections in reams of genomic data.

   But there are some problems that computers cannot solve -- at
   least not in a reasonable time frame.

   The question concerning which problems can and can't be solved
   efficiently, also known as "intractability," are a great
   scientific challenge for computer scientists. One such question
   is one of the longest-standing unsolved problems in computer
   science, something called "[95]P versus NP."


   This problem can be thought of as the question of whether every
   problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer
   can also be quickly solved by a computer. Or, put another way:
   is it substantially harder to find a solution than it is to
   check that a given solution is correct?

   (P vs. NP is one of the [96]Clay Mathematics Institute
   Millennium Prize Problems, with a million-dollar prize to
   whomever can find a solution.)


   Intractability -- if it truly exists -- means we might not be
   able to always find accurate, efficient algorithms for some
   important problems: from eliminating bugs from software
   programs, to knowing for sure if and when our encryption
   schemes are secure, to fully understanding how the brain works.

   Limitations in these areas would have implications for privacy,
   economics and many scientific and societal problems.

   Solving serious games

   Supported by a $10 million National Science Foundation (NSF)
   [97]Expeditions in Computing award, an interdisciplinary,
   multi-institutional team led by Sanjeev Arora at Princeton
   University worked between 2008 and 2013, to find the sources of
   intractability, to circumvent intractability when possible
   using approximations and other means, and to understand the
   implications of intractability for other areas, from physics
   and biology to economics and information theory.


   During that time, the team made several theoretical advances,
   including a new understanding of the [98]Unique Games
   Conjecture, which is one of the approaches used to try to make
   progress toward understanding the N versus NP question.


   The Unique Games Conjecture postulates that for many of the
   problems people would most like to solve, the current
   algorithms for finding a good approximation cannot be improved.

   Arora, working with Boaz Barak of Microsoft Research
   (previously of Princeton) and David Steurer of Cornell
   University, showed that there is an algorithm for solving
   Unique Games that is in fact better: one that is faster than
   exponential-time (where the time it takes to approximate the
   answer increases exponentially based on the data size) but
   still not as fast as polynomial-time (where the time to
   solution increases by a power of the data size). This means
   that some complex and seemingly intractable problems can be
   solved more efficiently than believed.

   Their [99]results were published in the October 2015 issue of
   the Journal of the ACM.


   On the other hand, Subhash Khot, a theoretical computer
   scientist on the team who introduced the conjecture in the
   first place and subsequently won the [100]2010 Alan T. Waterman
   Award, made important progress towards proving the Unique Games
   Conjecture was in fact true. (There is still no consensus in
   the community regarding the truth of the Unique Games
   Conjecture.)


   The team wrestled with a related real-world application as
   well: public-key cryptography, the means by which e-commerce
   and much of internet traffic is kept secure.

   All current forms of public-key cryptography (such as SSL and
   SSH) use a handful of algebraic methods. However, emerging
   algorithms, both classical and quantum, could break them all.
   The team derived fundamentally new forms of public-key
   cryptography that might remain secure far into the future -- a
   way of harnessing intractability to support cybersecurity.

   Insights from the study of intractability were applied to other
   fields, too. For instance, it was shown that the task of
   evaluating the worth of a financial derivative, the type of
   collateralized debt obligation that had a key role in the
   financial collapse of 2008, is related to solving intractable
   problems. In fact, under widely held intractability
   assumptions, it is possible for a person with secret
   information to construct derivatives that are basically
   indistinguishable from a normal derivative -- or more
   precisely, that distinguishing between the two requires a huge
   amount of computation -- but are actually worthless.

   "Some of the important leaps, for example in the understanding
   of efficient approximation, public key cryptography, arithmetic
   complexity and the role of intractability in other sciences,
   seem to happen mainly due to the collaborative environment of
   the Intractability Center, supported by the NSF Expedition,"
   said Avi Wigderson, a research team member from the Institute
   for Advanced Study. "I believe we proved that large groups can
   be effectively harnessed for theoretical projects."

   As an added benefit, the project served a training ground for
   theoretical computer scientists. According to Wigderson, "the
   project trained a couple of dozen students and postdocs, many
   of whom are young stars in algorithms and complexity theory."

   NSF Program Director Tracy Kimbrel agreed. "In addition to
   conducting world-class research in theoretical computer
   science, the team also innovated in attracting new talent to
   theory via new summer programs for undergraduates and high
   school students and a highly successful workshop where
   established women in theory reached out to undergraduate and
   entering graduate student women," Kimbrel said. "The role
   models at the '[101]Women in Theory' workshops have been
   credited with inspiring numerous women to pursue studies in
   theoretical computer science."


   The researchers continue to build on the progress of the
   Expedition, taking the improved understanding of intractability
   in new directions.

   New directions

   Arora and colleagues at Princeton, for instance, are currently
   working on a further NSF-supported project to develop machine
   learning algorithms with provable guarantees about the quality
   of the solutions they provide or the time it will take to run
   the algorithm.

   Such guarantees will be very important as machine learning
   algorithms are increasingly used for life-or-death applications
   like medical decision-making. Finding such guarantees often
   involves designing fundamentally new algorithms, or proving the
   guarantees for existing algorithms are sound.

   "It is fair to say that the ideas and young researchers
   generated by this project will continue to impact research for
   many years to come," Arora said.
