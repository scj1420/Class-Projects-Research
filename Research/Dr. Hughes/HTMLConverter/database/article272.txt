Network visualizations from my research

   My work in networks touches on social networks and a
   recent project visualizes such networks embedded in cultural
   works such as films or novels. This work is at the interface of
   graph theory, social networks, and the digital humanities.
   Below is a Gephi visualization of character relationships in
   the Twilight novel created by my graduate student David
   D’Angelo. The characters are nodes and two nodes are adjacent
   if they are spaced no more than fifteen words apart in the
   text. The edges are thicker if there are more of those
   co-occurrences; for example, Alice and Edward appear together
   in many scenes, as does Bella and Edward. Names were resized by
   their relative importance (measured by PageRank) in the text.

   We also can see the breakdown (in colors) of the community
   structure in Twilight, with vampires, Bella’s high school
   friends, and characters close to Charlie.

   Another recent study of mine considers a model for the
   evolution of social networks, called the Memoryless Geometric
   Protean graph model (or MGEO-P). In the model, nodes are placed
   randomly on a k-dimensional torus, and nodes are adjacent if
   they are close. “Close” here means within each other’s region
   of influence (governed by a random ranking function) as
   visualised by the blue and red squares in the figure below.

   MGEO-P deepened our understanding of dimensionality in social
   networks, which helps explain why few attributes are needed to
   identify agents in the network. We call this the
   [24]Logarithmic Dimension Hypothesis.
