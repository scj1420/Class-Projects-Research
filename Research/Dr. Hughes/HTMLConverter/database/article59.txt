   Hertha Marks Ayrton’s 162nd birthday

   Thank you to [26]Mathematician Sharon Lubkin, who called my
   attention to the Google doodle above, which was posted in honor
   of what would be Hertha Marks Ayrton’s 162nd birthday.   This
   led me to a fun jaunt through [27]her Wikipedia page – all of
   which was new to me.  Check it out!
