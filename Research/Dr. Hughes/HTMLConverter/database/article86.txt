       “The Clevelander”..I had to laugh when I read that as was
       there once myself, like many years ago and I just
       remembered that “the music never stops in that place’..it’s
       worth seeing just once I agree:)

       Amazing art!
       Was this before or after Yale beat Harvard? Rabb must have
       been elated! I am sure that helped the mood.

       If you’re into street art, there’s a section of Oakland,
       along Telegraph between roughly 20th and 30th Streets, that
       has some amazing stuff.
