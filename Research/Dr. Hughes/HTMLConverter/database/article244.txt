       While the limiting form 0^0 is indeterminate, there are
       good reasons to define the value 0^0 as 1 despite the
       nonremovable discontinuity there. In fact, we use this
       definition all the time, sometimes without realizing it.
       It’s why we can write a polynomial as p(x) = \sum_{n=0}^d
       a_nx^n . It’s why we can use the binomial theorem (a + b)^n
       = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom nk a^{n-k}b^k at a = 0 or b = 0 .
       It’s why we can use the power rule \frac{d}{dx}x^n =
       nx^{n-1} at n = 1 . It’s why we can write the number of
       functions from S to T as |T|^{|S|} even when S = T =
       \varnothing . See also Donald Knuth’s “[23]Two notes on
       notation” (1992) and [24]this Quora question.

       Very interesting and stimulating post, indeed! Where the
       discussion involves level sets approaching the origin,
       there’s a typo:
       \ln(x^y) = x\ln(y) should be
       \ln(x^y) = y\ln(x) [31]Reply

       After studying mathematics for a while, I came to the
       conclusion that exponentiation of arbitrary numbers x^y is
       actually a quite artificial operation compared to things
       like addition and multiplication; there’s only the power
       function x^k defined for arbitrary x and integer k as x
       multiplied by itself k times, or its reciprocal -k times,
       and the exponential function \exp(\cdot) defined by the
       limit of (1+\tfrac x n)^n or the power series \sum \frac
       {x^n} {n!} . It’s just a happy coincidence that they can be
       made to agree (and then be interpolated) by setting x^k =
       \exp(k \ln(x)) . Most justifications for setting 0^0 = 1
       rely on the properties of the former function; others are
       combinatorial, which still boils down to the same function.
       I resolve similarly the question of whether zero is a
       natural number: it’s meaningless, just as asking whether
       Pluto is a planet. I regard natural numbers as (ironically)
       one of the most artificial concepts in mathematics. Instead
       of speaking about them, one should rather refer to finite
       cardinal/ordinal numbers (of which zero is a perfectly
       valid example) or equivalence classes, under multiplication
       by units, of integers having a prime decomposition (in
       which case zero isn’t among them).

       Interesting post!
       Here’s one attempt to visualise the level sets:
       [44][exponential_level_sets.gif]
       This takes regions of the level sets for which x lies in
       the unit disk and projects them into the 3-dimensional
       subspace of \mathbb{C}^2 given by dropping the imaginary
       part of y from each pair (x,y) . The three surfaces shown
       in each frame of the animation are for values of z with
       magnitudes 1/2, 1 and 3/2, and the argument of z runs from
       0 to 2 \pi over the course of the animation.

            Sorry, this isn’t showing quite what I intended. I
            said that z takes values with magnitudes 1/2, 1, and
            3/2 and arguments ranging between 0 and 2\pi , but in
            fact the level sets I’m showing use those values for
            ln(z) rather than z.
            I didn’t read the post carefully enough, and check the
            formulas I was using. At one point in the post it is
            correctly stated that the parametric form of the level
            set for x^y = z is (x, ln(z)/ln(x)), which of course
            is the formula I should have used. But later in the
            post there’s a typo:


     … the formula for the level set L(z), which is y = z / ln(x)
            and I used that to make the image.
            So the image does still show level sets of the
            function x^y , but the particular values of z used are
            a bit weird: \exp(r \exp(i \phi)) with \phi ranging
            from 0 to 2\pi over the course of the animation, and r
            taking the values 1/2, 1 and 3/2 in each frame.

            Hi Greg, that looks really nice. I fixed the typo in
            the article, thanks for pointing it out, and also
            edited your comment to make the syntax corrections you
            indicated. Sorry that the typo percolated into your
            animation.
            My impression from the images here are that the level
            sets look like they fit together in a smooth way — and
            each level set doesn’t have a chaotic appearance, even
            towards the origin.
            For an individual level set, what statements can be
            made about the tangent space, near the origin?

       The image didn’t show up in my last comment, probably
       because I used an img tag rather than just mentioning the
       URL. I’m a bit worried that WordPress might clone the image
       rather than showing the original file, which will cause
       headaches if I want to improve the original. So … I’ll
       mention the URL in human-readable form here for anyone who
       wants to look at it, and hope WordPress doesn’t interpret
       it.

            Since most people will be too lazy to follow that
            link, I copied your image to my website and put that
            version in your original post. If you want to change
            it just send me a new version and I’ll do what it
            takes to get that to appear (by giving it a new name).
            Sorry things are a bit annoying.
            If anyone wants to simply post an image here, just
            type in its URL. If the URL ends in .gif, .jpg or
            .png, the image will show up. Unfortunately WordPress
            will create a copy of your image and show that, so if
            you later change your image, that change won’t appear
            here.

       Another nice thing about 0^0=1 is that it plays nicely with
       the convention in information theory that p\log p=0 when
       p=0 , since e^{p\log p} = p^p .

       David, Excellent post! A beautiful example in math of
       investigating the simplest issue of the deepest
       consequence. Also, a vivid illustration of “implicit math”,
       that is, what goes on in our minds.
       I taught a precalculus course at UCSD where I tried to
       distill the deepest ideas. One of them was “extending the
       domain”, in particular, of the addition formula 2^(x+y) =
       2^x 2^y . Supposing that we know what this means for x, y =
       1,2,3… then we can extend the domain to 0 by asking what
       2^0 must mean for the addition formula to continue to hold.
       Well, generally, a^x = a^x+0 = a^x a^0 and so a^0 = 1.
       However, at this point, if a=0 , then we could have 0^0=0 .
       This issue is dealt with first and only then do we extend
       the domain further for x = -1, -2, -3… and derive = a^-1 =
       1/a . Whereas you use the latter to define what 0^0 must
       be. So I find that point in your derivation unconvincing, a
       sleight of hand.
       Also, I’m curious what your thinking about 0^0 means for
       the field with one element where 0 = 1 = infinity.

            Andrius, thanks, I appreciate your enthusiasm for
            these subjects.
            Tomorrow when the new day brings a chance to begin
            again, I will speak to your concern that my argument
            was a kind of party trick.
            Regarding your question about the field with one
            element, where 0 = 1 = infinity, the serious answer to
            your question is that I don’t have an opinion about
            zero-to-the-zero here, because I have never thought
            about this field before.
            I just read the wikipedia article on the field with
            one element,
            nt, and I was surprised to see that the theory of a
            field with just one element was not trivial. On a
            first reading, I didn’t really get it.
            What is the connection here with infinity?

                 David, briefly, I’ve been realizing that a lot of
                 the discussion of the field with one element
                 comes from considerations of the finite field Fq
                 of characteristic q where we are counting, for
                 example, the number of k-dimensional subspaces of
                 n-dimensional vector spaces. The answers are
                 polynomials in q. But then I realized that from
                 the point of view of these fields, q is just 0.
                 And all of this counting is ridiculous from their
                 point of view. Kind of like counting the number
                 of ways that you can add positive and negative
                 numbers to get 0. And then I realized that for
                 these fields, from their point of view, q is
                 infinity. So for the field with one element, it’s
                 like a clock with a single hour which means 0 or
                 1 or infinity, depending on how you think about
                 it. For example, 0 * infinity = infinity * 0 = 1.
                 These are just some thoughts I’m working on.

     Whereas you use the latter to define what 0^0 must be. So I
     find that point in your derivation unconvincing, a sleight
     of hand.
            Let me try a different approach to the same point.
            There are all kinds of ways that we could define 0^0 ,
            but there is only one definition of it that doesn’t
            call for special exceptions to be added to the general
            catalog of statements of mathematical facts.
            Anders gave a good list of these facts, in the first
            comment to this post.
            One of the clearest there is this: how many functions
            are there from a set of size A to a set of size B?
            Clearly, it is B^A .
            In the article, I pointed towards another such fact:
            the multiplicative inverse of a^x is a^{-x} .
            Now, if 0^0 is defined as anything other than 1, we
            would have to modify the statements above, to say: the
            number of functions is B^A , except when A and B are
            empty, then it is 1. And the multiplicative inverse of
            a^x is a^{-x} , except when a and x are both zero.
            So, if nothing else other than sheer laziness, why
            don’t we go with the most “globally parsimonious”
            definition?
            I also think that these are hints about what the gods
            of mathematics prefer :)

                 For me, the rule of thumb is that 0^0 = 1 is
                 essentially always the correct convention in
                 discrete math contexts (including, e.g., the
                 situation where we are decategorifying from
                 finite sets). For continuous math contexts,
                 wherever you want exponentiation as a binary
                 operation to be continuous on its domain of
                 definition, it seems to be safest to declare 0^0
                 to be undefined, and leave it at that. For
                 different paths to (0, 0) lead to different
                 limits.
                 So the point is that it’s really just a matter of
                 being mindful of the surrounding context — I
                 don’t think there’s any controversy about that
                 point for practicing mathematicians.

                      This is the sense in which the integers have
                      to be considered on their own in their fully

            I am having trouble studying it in detail, because its
            turning pretty quickly. Can you post any still shots

            going on. Or a very slowly turning version.
            I’m not totally sure what the axes are, because
            they’re not labeled, but by inference the half-axis to
            which the surface is attached is the positive x-axis.
            It appears that the surface isn’t plotted for the
            region with negative values for y? Was that
            intentional, perhaps to make the structure of the
            surface more visible?

            The horizontal arrows demarcate the first quadrant,
            that is, the region where x > 0 and y > 0. You can see
            that the function being graphed, namely x^y, equals
            zero along the y axis, since 0^y = 0 for y > 0 . And
            if you look harder you can see that it takes a
            constant positive value along the x axis, consistent
            with the fact that x^0 = 1 for x > 0.

       I remember reading a historical article about some obscure
       mathematician (obviously working before the modern
       distinction between functions and formulas was worked out)
       who came up with the idea of using something like this as
       an indicator function — if I recall correctly, I think his
       involved a tower of exponents with multiple zeroes that
       somehow made him feel it was better justified — and felt
       that this was an extremely important contribution to
       mathematics. Of course in some sense it was, since he was
       anticipating the definition of more general functions than
       things that could be “represented by formulas.”

            The determinant of a square n x n matrix is obtained
            as the sum, with appropriate signs, of n factorial
            products, each of which is composed of n factors. If
            we let n be zero, this is zero factorial terms each
            composed of zero factors – that is to say one term
            composed of no factors and therefore possessing the
            value one. Hence the sum must be one.

            I’d like there to be an empty manifold of each
            dimension. There are times when I want a category of
            n-manifolds and smooth maps between them. If there’s
            an empty n-manifold, this category will have finite
            coproducts! In other words: they have coproducts
            (disjoint unions), and making there be an empty
            n-manifold means they also have an initial object.
            It’s also true that the empty set is an n-manifold for
            each n if we say “an n-manifold is a topological space
            such that each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic
            to \mathbb{R}^n. ”
            There’s also a category of manifolds where different
            components are allowed to have different dimensions,
            and this is a kind of rig category, with finite
            products and coproducts. In this category, the
            question “what is the dimension of this manifold?”
            doesn’t make sense; the right question is “what is the
            dimension of this component of a manifold?”, and the
            empty manifold has no components.

            @David: that’s the correct answer, but a much more
            conceptual derivation is possible. The determinant of
            a linear transformation T : V \to V from a
            finite-dimensional vector space to itself is the
            scalar by which T acts on the top exterior power of V
            , which is 1 -dimensional. If \dim V = 0 then the top
            exterior power is the zeroth one, which is the unit
            (that is, the underlying field, as a 1 -dimensional
            vector space), with T acting by multiplication by 1 .
            A related but more concrete argument is that 1 is the
            unique answer consistent with cofactor expansion for a
            1 \times 1 matrix.

            I made a stupid mistake in both [138]the image above
            and [139]an earlier image: the phases for z all have
            an extra factor of \pi compared to what was intended,
            and so instead of running from 0 to 2\pi over the
            animation, they run from 0 to 2\pi^2 . No wonder these
            images seem to go through multiple cycles within each
            animation, and jump strangely between the end and the
            start.
            I won’t redo these animations, though, since they
            don’t really show what’s happening near the origin,
            which is where things are interesting. The two images
            below
            [140]here and [141]here hopefully make it clear what
            happens to the level sets near the origin.

       Suppose we fix two complex numbers, x_0 \neq 0 and y_0 .
       Then along the straight line through the origin in
       \mathbb{C}^2 that passes through (x_0, y_0) , we have:
       \lim_{s \to 0} (s y_0) \log(s x_0) = 0
       \lim_{s \to 0} (s x_0)^{s y_0} = 1
       So, x^y approaches 1 as we approach the origin along any
       such line.
       The only way to get values other than 1 is to make x
       exponentially smaller than y , and approach the origin
       along a curve such as:
       (x(s),y(s)) = (\exp(-1/s) x_0, s y_0)
       We then have:
       \lim_{s \to 0} (s y_0) \log(\exp(-1/s) x_0) = -y_0
       \lim_{s \to 0} (\exp(-1/s) x_0)^{s y_0} = \exp(-y_0)
       So the level set x^y = z for any complex number z comes
       arbitrarily close to the origin in \mathbb{C}^2 , but all
       these sets for z \neq 1 approach the surface x=0 very
       rapidly as they approach the origin.

       It’s apparent here that the sets for z\neq 1 converge

     Are you getting any kind of mental picture about what the
     structure looks like as a whole?
            Treating x as the parameter for each level set L(z) ,
            as you approach x=0 along different straight lines
            through the origin, x_{\theta}(r) = r exp(i \theta) ,
            the unit tangents wrt r to the corresponding paths
            through L(z) all converge on a vector in \mathbb{C}^2
            that is independent of \theta :
            (0, -\log(z) / |\log(z)|)
            So not only do the level sets squeeze down into
            something almost 1-dimensional as they approach the
            origin, different level sets L(z_1) and L(z_2)
            approach along almost the same line when \log(z_1) is
            a real multiple of \log(z_2) .
            So I don’t think the foliation is pathologically
            twisted as you approach the origin, but most sets are
            squashed together ever closer to the surface x=0 ,
            while the sets L(z) for z close to 1 occupy more and
            more space around the origin.

       Here’s an attempt to show the full, four-dimensional shapes
       of the level sets by taking a rotating slice.
       [162][ExponentialLevelSets5.gif]
       Each frame gives a 3-dimensional “radial” slice through
       \mathbb{C}^2 for a particular phase for x . There are 24
       level sets shown, coloured red, green, and blue for
       magnitudes 1/2,1, and 3/2, with 8 equally-spaced phases at
       each magnitude. The unchanging vertical green line is for
       z=1 .
       As with the other images, it’s clear that most of the level
       sets rapidly approach x=0 as they approach the origin, with
       z=1 the exception. Of course the level sets fill the whole
       space, so the gaps between z=1 and the other sets will be
       filled mostly by sets with z very close to 1.

       If we look at exponentiation on the natural numbers as
       nothing more than repeated multiplication, then it seems to
       be impossible to justify any particular value for 0^0 .
       There are in fact infinitely many binary functions ^ on N
       that satisfy n^2 = n\cdot n and n^{m+1}=n^m \cdot n . The
       thing is, they disagree only on the value of 0^0 for which
       any value will do. Thus, we might be justified in simply
       leaving it undefined.

            I see what you’re saying. However I have become

            that n^m = n^{m+0} = n^m \cdot n^0 , and that n^m
            \cdot n^{-m} = 1 . If it is to be defined, these

            I thought it was widely agreed that multiplying no
            numbers at all gives the answer 1, just as the sum of
            no numbers at all equals 0. If so, the fact that the
            numbers you’re multiplying none of happen to all equal
            zero shouldn’t affect the answer. Just as eating no
            doughnuts has the same effect on your waistline as
            eating no sticks of celery, multiplying your wealth by
            zero no times at all should have the same effect as
            doubling it no times at all. This is just a
            plausibility argument, but in category theory we turn
            it into a theorem: the empty product is the terminal

                 Consider multiplying repeatedly by 0 . We can

                 \times 0 = 0^2 = 0 . The trouble is, this

            That does work. And it looks like Matt Harden wrote it

            If you ever need to write a URL with characters other
            than letters, numbers, dash, underscore, period or
            tilde (the “unreserved characters” in the table
            [196]here), and they aren’t playing a role in the
            syntax of the URL (like a forward slash, a colon, or
            any of the other “reserved characters” listed in the
            same article), then the most robust way to write those
            characters is with a percent sign followed by two
            hexadecimal digits giving the character code.
            You can even do this for characters with codes beyond
            the normal 8-bit range, but then you need to convert
            the code into UTF-8 and express it as multiple bytes.
            This is a bit of a pain in the neck, and it can make
            some links to Wikipedia articles tedious to write,
            because they like using em-dashes and accented
            characters that can only be expressed this way.

       In my opinion, the right way to resolve this question is to
       say that the notation x^y refers to multiple distinct
       functions. These functions are:
       x^n where n is a natural number and x is an arbitrary
       complex number. This function is used to define polynomials
       and power series. With this function we must have 0^0 = 1
       for the function to be well-behaved.
       x^i where i is an integer and x is a nonzero complex
       number.
       e^x where x is a complex number is the exponential
       function. The e at the bottom is just a symbol, though by
       abuse of notation some people define the number e = e^1 ,
       which makes this power compatible with other power
       functions.
       x^y = e^{y \log x} where x is a positive real number and y
       is a complex number. We can also extend this to be defined
       for any x in a set where \log x can be defined
       consistently, or even to all nonzero x if we make this a
       multi-valued function. We can also extend the function
       continuously so that 0^x = 0 for all positive real numbers
       x . However, there is no way to extend this function
       continuously to (0,0), so with this function 0^0 is
       undefined.
       These functions are frequently confused because in any
       point where two of them are defined, they give the same
       value. However, it is crucial to distinguish them when
       analyzing the expression 0^0 : According to the first
       definition it is 1 , but according to the rest it is
       undefined. Finally, applying this to your riddle, I must
       object to your solution as well: There is no single power
       function such that 0^x looks like that.

       The thing about x ^ y , is that it’s not even discontinious
       at 0^y. What happens is seen by letting x approach 0, it
       goes up sharply at y -> 0, and always passes through 1 at
       y=0.
       Any line of the form x^ax (a sloping line) converges on 1
       when x = 0, without dispute.
       Edging along the line of y=0, and x ->0, is a kind of
       division by zero.
