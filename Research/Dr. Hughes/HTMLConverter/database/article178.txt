   Five and a half years ago she was an orphan in Ethiopia and
   couldn’t speak a word of English. Now she’s in the current No.
   1 movie in the country.

   Lidya Jewett, 9, of Palm City, portrays a young Katherine G.
   Johnson in “Hidden Figures,” the story of three
   African-American women who who were the mathematical brains at
   NASA and played pivotal roles in the historic mission that sent
   John Glenn into space.

   The young actress beat out 3,000 other girls to get the part in
   the Twentieth Century Fox feature film. She and her mom were
   shopping at Michael’s when they got the call.

   “I cried and cried,” Lidya said. “Tears of joy.”

   The movie, which was filmed in Georgia last Spring, stars
   Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monáe, Kevin
   Costner and Kirsten Dunst.

   "I don't really get nervous because it's fun," Lidya said. "I
   love people and I get to meet all these new people."

   The film, which beat out "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" at the
   box office last weekend, opens with Lidya standing at a
   chalkboard solving a seven-line math equation. The scene was
   shot in one take.

   “I’d like to be a mathematician when I grow up,” she said. “And
   I loved math even before the movie.”

   Kim Jewett said her daughter’s intellect and mathematical
   aptitude became evident shortly after she joined their family
   in 2011. Kim and Dale Jewett, both in their mid-40s, were moved
   to add to their biological family of five after friends
   adopted. They contacted an adoption agency and after two trips
   to Ethiopia, Lidya made them a family of six.

   Kim Jewett said that rather than play with the toys she had
   purchased for her new daughter, Lidya would make patterns out
   of everything. Lining up pencils, salt shakers and crayons on
   the table.

   She learned English within months and was reading chapter books
   after a year.

   Lidya has been home-schooled since the first grade and is a
   STEM student, focusing on science, technology, engineering and
   mathematics.

   “I like it (home schooling) because you can go through things
   faster,” Lidya said.
