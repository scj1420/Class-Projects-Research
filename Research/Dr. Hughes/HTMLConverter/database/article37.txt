Maximising your chance of success

   For a given number of $N$ people you want to choose $M$ so that
   you maximise $P(M,N)$ . This means that we want
     \[ P(M-1,N) < P(M,N). \]

   Substituting the expressions for $P(M-1,N)$ and $P(M,N)$ from
   the equation above and manipulating the inequality gives
     $\displaystyle 1 < \frac{1}{M} + \frac{1}{M+1} +
     \frac{1}{M+2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{N-1}. $

   (See [18]this article for the detailed calculation.)


   We can go through the same calculation for $P(M+1,N) < P(M,N)$
   and find that
     $\displaystyle 1 > \frac{1}{M+1} + \frac{1}{M+2} +
     \frac{1}{M+3} + \ldots + \frac{1}{N-1}. $

   Now let’s play with some numbers. If $N=4$ , so there are only
   four people, the only value of $M$ that satisfies the two
   inequalities is $M=1$ , which is 25% of $N$ :
     \[ \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} < 1 < \frac{1}{1}

   This means you should discard the first person and then go for
   the next one that tops the previous ones.

   If $N=5$ , so there are only five people, the only value of $M$
   for which the two inequalities hold is $M=2$ , which is 40% of
   $N$ :
     \[ \frac{7}{12}=\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} < 1 < \frac{1}{2} +
     \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{13}{12}. \]

   So you should discard the first two people and then go for the
   next one that tops the previous ones.

   These percentages are nowhere near 37, but as you crank up the
   value of $N$ , they get closer to the magic number. For twenty
   potential partners ( $N=20$ ) you should choose $M=7$ , which
   is 35% of $N$ . For fifty ( $N=50$ ) you should choose $M=18$ ,
   which is 36% of $N$ . For a hundred potential partners (
   $N=100$ ) you should choose $M = 37$ (that’s obviously 37% of
   $N$ ) and for (an admittedly unrealistic) 1000 ( $N=1000$ ) you
   should choose $M = 368$ , which is 36.8% of $N$ .

   Here's the plot of the best value of $M/N$ against $N$ again,
   confirming the 37% rule.

   This figure was created by John Billingham for the article
   [19]Kissing the frog: A mathematician's guide to mating, which
   looks at results and problems related to the 37% rule in more
   detail.


   There's actually a more rigorous way of estimating the
   proportion, rather than just drawing a picture, but it involves
   calculus. If you follow that argument, you will see that the
   "about 37%" really mean a proportion of $1/e$ where $e$ is the
   base of the natural logarithm: $e \approx 2.718$ so $1/e
   \approx 0.368$ . Those who are interested should read [20]this
   article, which looks at the problem in terms of a princess
   kissing frogs and has the detailed calculations.


   So what's your chance of ending up with X with the 37%
   strategy? It's roughly 37%! The magic number 37 turns up twice
   in this context, both as the probability and the optimal
   proportion. This comes out of the underlying mathematics, which
   you can see in the [21]article just mentioned. Thus, using the
   37% strategy your chance of ending up with X is just over a
   third. That's not great odds, but, as we have seen, it's the
   best you can expect with a strategy like this one.
