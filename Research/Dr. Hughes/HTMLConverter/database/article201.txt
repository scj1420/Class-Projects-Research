   On-air challenge:

   In a series of categories, name something in the category
   starting with each of the letters W-I-N-D-S. Any answer that
   works is fine, and you can give the answers in any order.

   For example: Two-Syllable Girls' Names —> Wilma, Ingrid, Nancy,
   Donna, and Suzanne.
   Last week's challenge: What two eight-letter terms in math are
   anagrams of each other? One word is from geometry, and the
   other is from calculus. What words are they?

   Answer: Triangle, integral.

   Winner: Makena Dyer of Honolulu, Hawaii.

   Next week's challenge: Bail, Nail, and Mail are three
   four-letter words that differ only by their first letters. And
   those first letters (B, N, and M) happen to be adjacent on a
   computer keyboard. Can you think of five four-letter words that
   have the same property — that is, they're identical except for
   their first letters, with those first letters being adjacent on
   the keyboard? All five words must be ones that everyone knows.
   Capitalized words and plurals are not allowed. What words are
   they?
