and discoveries

   Think back to a favorite picture book, the one where the edges
   of the cover grew worn and a few pages loosened from the
   binding after so many readings. Perhaps it was the unfolding
   story that enthralled a young you, perhaps the luminous
   illustrations. Most likely it was the view the book offered
   into a different world.

   "Picture books are some of the first memories I have for
   looking at and understanding the world around me," says J.D.
   Talasek, the director of the [160]Cultural Programs of the
   National Academy of Sciences. But one doesn't have to be a
   child to find delight and wonder in images from children's
   books. That's the premise behind a new exhibition,
   "[161]Igniting the Imagination," which opened this week at the
   National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in Washington D.C.


   The exhibition features 29 artworks from the collection of
   children's book illustrations at the [162]Mazza Museum, located
   at the University of Findlay in Ohio. Each illustration
   explores the worlds of science, engineering or medicine. In
   one, a bespectacled older gentleman and his companion, a young
   boy in a red t-shirt, lean to the side as they feel the
   centrifugal force of a rollercoaster's curve. The man's hat
   floats above and behind him, pushed off by the wind of his
   motion. In another, sea turtles appear to take off like a flock
   of sea-green-colored birds from a tower of pink, branching
   coral. A third juxtaposes the size of a Volkswagen Beetle
   driven by a poofy-haired woman with a stegosaurus sporting the
   same pale violet coloration as the vehicle.


   The illustrations come from books that span the past
   half-century: The oldest is from [163]Project Boy by Lois
   Lenski, published in 1954, and shows a group of children
   building a fort out of "junk." The subjects traipse from the
   magic of math to the biology of a decaying log to the
   engineering of a skyscraper.


   "The exhibit is framed through these disciplines, but it uses
   the power of art to help make broader connections to how
   inventions, practices and discoveries frame our experiences,"
   Talasek says.

   Each image was selected to grab the viewer's attention through
   color, composition or the presence of something unusual and
   unexpected. "There is a kind of preconceived notion that art
   from children's books is simple, but you will see that the
   technical skill is astounding," says Dan Chudzinski, the
   curator of the Mazza Museum. "They would be at home in any art
   gallery."

   The museum's collection [164]was born in 1982, as part of a
   celebration of the 100th anniversary of Findlay College, the
   university's predecessor institution. Jerry Mallett, a
   professor of education at the time, spearheaded the
   establishment of the children's book illustration collection.
   What began as four pieces then has grown to more than 10,500
   now through donations and acquisitions. The artworks include a
   diversity of styles and media.


   An image from the book [165]City Beats, illustrated by Jeanette
   Canyon, shows three pigeons perched on a twisted metal cable,
   overlooking a construction site. A reader holding the book
   itself might marvel at the plumpness of the pigeons, the
   weighty thickness of the cable and the stylish pebbled
   appearance of the sky and cityscape background. In person, the
   illustration proves to be a three-dimensional relief sculpture
   molded out of polymer clay. The sculpture was photographed for
   the book.


   Other selections have similar surprises in store. Illustrator
   Robin Brickman crafted the ecosystem that springs up around a
   decaying log in [166]A Log's Life from meticulously-cut pieces
   of paper. Gennady Spirin's scene of a cabin boy aboard a ship
   in [167]To the Edge of the World, illustrated in a style
   reminiscent of a renaissance painting, is packed with details
   to reward the patient viewer—a map of the Gulf of Mexico
   replete with the approximations of early cartography and an
   old-style compass that Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan
   might have used.


   "The whole point is to pique curiosity," Chudzinski says. "We
   want the art to be a catalyst to get someone to pick up the
   book and then learn science along the way." To aid that
   mission, copies of the books and comfy chairs for visitors to
   curl up in and read accompany the artworks on view at the NAS.

   The exhibition sprang from an experience Jay Labov, the senior
   advisor for education and communication for the [168]National
   Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine had as a
   visiting scholar to the University of Findlay.


   Labov travels the country giving talks about STEM (Science,
   Technology, Engineering and Math) education. "One of the talks
   is about the importance of science as a liberal art in the 21st
   century," he says. "Too often we see, particularly in higher
   education, science being divorced from humanities." When he
   visited the Mazza Museum and gazed at paintings and drawings,
   the intricate design of a fold-out book caught his eye. A
   placard explained that engineers had helped design the pop-up
   constructions.

   "It occurred to me that the illustrations in children's books
   were showing us interesting ways to understand science," he
   says.

   "I know Jay has the heart of a child, playfulness and
   curiosity," Talasek says. "But he also just had a grandchild at
   that point, so the exhibition is a very personal recommendation
   for Jay."

   "I did end up buying a lot of the books for my granddaughter,"
   Labov says.

   Adults visiting the exhibition may find themselves remembering
   the wonder they felt learning about science as a child. But
   children may glean something more. At least, that's what the
   organizers hope.

   Talasek explains exactly what that "more" may be with an
   anecdote. One of the illustrations comes from [169]You Are the
   First Kid on Mars by Patrick O'Brien. In it, three space-suited
   figures stride across rusty soil to approach the glistening,
   solar-paneled back of a robotic rover on the surface of the Red
   Planet.


   The book itself inspired an astronaut to write the author with
   compliments: "This is the kind of book that I dreamed of as a
   kid, and the reason I became a physicist and astronomer. This
   is the first time since the 1970s that I have seen the
   excitement of space travel conveyed in a way that is both
   inspiring and plausible."
