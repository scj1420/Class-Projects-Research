   Cheng is the School of the Art Institute of Chicago’s energetic
   scientist-in-residence, and she thinks math is elegant,
   beautiful and even delicious. In her classes at the Art
   Institute, she teaches painters and sculptors that math is a
   creative process. For the rest of us, she’s written a book,
   “How to Bake Pi,” which uses the example of warm, baked goods
   (and other treats) to illustrate mathematical concepts.

   For Cheng, the line connecting mathematics and baking is pretty
   clear: Both are messy, fun experiments.

   “There are so many desserts you can make with basically the
   same ingredients,” she says. “You just put them together in
   different ways. And math is a bit like that. You take some
   basic ingredients — numbers or shapes — and then you put them
   together in some fantastic ways. It's really more about the
   method … not just the end result.”

   The baking analogy dawned on her when she was teaching math to
   undergraduates, many of whom were struggling to connect with
   the concepts covered in class. Her students, turned off by
   years of memorizing formulas, couldn’t relate to the subject.
   Cheng can hardly blame them.

   “If you're learning something and you have no emotional
   connection with it, then it's very hard for it to stick,” she
   says. “And so when I compare [math] with food, it gives
   everyone a way of feeling an emotional connection with it.”

   In class, Cheng sometimes guides her students through projects
   that don’t have “answers” at all, which she says is closer to
   what mathematical research is really like. “So, it's not about
   getting the right answer,” she says. “It's about exploring the
   situation. And then whatever you discover about the situation
   is valid.”

   Likewise, in her book, Cheng keeps the same focus on using
   imagination, this time to combine kitchen ingredients — and
   numbers. She [137]baked gooey chocolate lava cakes with Studio
   360’s Kurt Andersen to show how it’s done. The first principle
   of cakes? Don’t bother memorizing a recipe.


   “If you start with an equal weight of every ingredient then
   it's about right,” she says.

   Being well-versed in baking methods means that we’re free to
   experiment with ingredients — similar to what we can do with
   numbers once we understand the foundations of math, she says.
   Find yourself suddenly hosting friends for dinner, and you
   don’t have a clue what to serve them?

   “You can just find stuff in your kitchen and invent something
   using the basic principles that you know,” she says. “If you
   understand the principles, then you can mess around knowing
   which principles you need to stick to and which ones you should
   [or] can mess with.”

   Having a firm grasp on the basic principles of baking and math
   allows us to invent things under all sorts of circumstances,
   Cheng says. This is why we do math, and it’s why math can help
   us understand other complex concepts like shapes, or
   space-time, or baseball.

   “People think math is about numbers. But we understand the
   principles behind numbers so that we can work with things that
   aren't numbers, and see if they can be treated in the same kind
   of way,” she says.

   It’s a lot to think about — best to start with a chocolatey
   lava cake.
