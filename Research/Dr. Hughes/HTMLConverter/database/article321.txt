   Welcome to The Riddler. Every week, I offer up a problem
   related to the things we hold dear around here: math, logic and
   probability. These problems, puzzles and riddles come from lots
   of top-notch puzzle folks around the world ‚Äî including you!
   You‚Äôll find this week‚Äôs puzzle below.

   Mull it over on your commute, dissect it on your lunch break,
   and argue about it with your friends and lovers. When you‚Äôre
   ready, submit your answer using the link below. I‚Äôll reveal the
   solution next week, and a correct submission (chosen at random)
   will earn a shoutout in this column. Important small print: To
   be eligible, I need to receive your correct answer before 11:59
   p.m. EDT on Sunday ‚Äî have a great weekend!

   Before we get to the new puzzle, let‚Äôs return to [19]last
   week‚Äôs. Congratulations to üëè Adam Kalinich üëè of Glen Ellyn,
   Illinois, our big winner. You can find a solution to the
   previous Riddler at the bottom of this post.


   Now here‚Äôs this week‚Äôs Riddler, a centre court tennis puzzle
   that comes to us from Ted LeMoine, a professional poker player
   from Medford, Massachusetts.
     __________________________________________________________

   Your wish has been granted, and you get to play tennis against
   Roger Federer in his prime in the Wimbledon final. You have
   only a 1 percent chance to win each point, but Roger, sporting
   gentleman that he is, offers to let you name any score and
   begin the match at that point. (So, if you‚Äôve entertained a
   fantasy of storming back after being down three match points in
   the fifth set, now‚Äôs the time to live it.) What score can you
   name that gives you the best chance to win, and what is your
   chance of winning the title?

   Extra credit: It‚Äôs been a while, so let‚Äôs offer up a üèÜ Coolest
   Riddler Extension Award üèÜ. Improve your tennis skills, make
   more realistic assumptions (about serving, etc.), or something
   even more creative. The winner gets a shiny emoji trophy next
   week.

   And here‚Äôs the answer to [23]last week‚Äôs Riddler, concerning a
   robot that slices your pizza, randomly and independently
   chooses two points on the pie‚Äôs circumference, and then slices
   along the chord connecting them. If you ask the robot to make
   three such cuts, you can expect your pizza to have five pieces,
   on average.


   The key thing to notice for this problem is that the only thing
   that matters is the order of the points around the circle
   selected by the robot ‚Äî the points‚Äô exact positions within that
   order don‚Äôt matter at all. (Their positions will affect the
   slice sizes, but here we only care about the number of slices.)

   Think about it this way: First, picture six random points
   around your circular pizza pie. Pick any one point to start
   with, then randomly choose one of the remaining five, and slice
   between them. Now pick another point to start with, and pair it
   randomly with one of the three remaining points, and slice
   between those. Finally, there are only two points left, so you
   slice between those. That‚Äôs 15 possibilities. Five of these
   yield four pieces, six yield five pieces, three yield six
   pieces and one yields seven pieces. Here is [24]an illustration
   of the possible arrangements and their slice counts, from
   Laurent Lessard:

   Thanks to the way the robot randomizes its cuts, each scenario
   above occurs with equal probability. Therefore, the average
   number of pieces is (5*4+6*5+3*6+1*7)/15 = 75/15 = 5.

   (Note also that there are some weird possibilities we didn‚Äôt
   consider, like the robot choosing the exactly same chord twice,
   or all three chords intersecting at one point, like how you‚Äôd
   normally try to slice a pizza. However, these happen with
   probability zero, so don‚Äôt factor into our calculation of the
   expectation.)

   For the more engineering-minded Riddler solvers, Gabe
   Pezanoski-Cohen put together a little [25]pizza robot simulator
   that can make any number of cuts. There is also an elegant
   generalized solution: If the robot makes k random cuts, the
   expected number of slices is (k+2)(k+3)/6. As the puzzle‚Äôs
   contributor Zach Wissner-Gross explains, this can be shown by
   induction: If the expected number of pieces resulting from k
   cuts is E(k), then the expected number of pieces for k+1 cuts
   is E(k+1)=E(k)+1+k/3. Why? Slicing along a new random chord
   will always add one slice, and the new chord has a one-third
   chance of intersecting each of the already sliced chords.
   Combining that with the fact that one cut gives two pieces, or
   E(1)=2, we [26]arrive at the generalized solution. Mmm, pizza.
