   Who says jocks and nerds can’t get along? The Colorado Rockies
   had a clever take for Pi Day (a.k.a. 3/14) on Tuesday.

     What are the chances!?[193]#PiDay

   The team now [196]admits the image was Photoshopped, which we
   should’ve known because [197]no Rockies player has ever worn
   No. 89, for example, but we don’t care. It’s still delightful.
   And for the record, it’s also 100 percent accurate. Indeed, the
   first 30 digits of pi are 3.14159265358979323846264338327. And
   the next 30 are 950288419716939937510582097494, but who’s
   counting?


   While the Rockies may have posted the most intricate Pi Day
   celebration on social media, they’re not the only sports
   organization to nerd out.

     Just like the decimals in π, our thanks for our supporters
     is infinite

   what she calls the “cultural anthropological” side of sports,
   a.k.a. “mostly the fun stuff.”
