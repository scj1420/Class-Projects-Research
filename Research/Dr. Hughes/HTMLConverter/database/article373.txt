   This is the second edition of a book first published in the
   [309]Springer Briefs series. It is closely related to (but
   seems more accessible than) Belenky’s earlier
   [310]Understanding the Fundamentals of the U.S. Presidential
   Election System. Since this is a Springer Open title, it is
   freely available online. The second edition includes several
   corrections and new examples.


     Also, it adds to the Conclusion a brief description of (a)
     fundamental merits, (b) particular deficiencies embedded in
     the system via the Constitution, and (c) some urgent
     problems of this system as the author views them.

     Finally it offers a new topic on the election system to
     discuss. This topic deals with national televised
     presidential debates. It covers current requirements for
     presidential candidates to participate in the debates, and
     what the candidates from both established non-major
     political parties and independent ones need to demonstrate
     these requirements. In addition, a new proposal on how to
     organize and hold televised presidential debates that would
     allow all these candidates to participate.

   As those paragraphs indicate, Belenky is not afraid to make
   suggestions for change, which may make his book particularly
   interesting to those who would like to consider whether such
   changes are desirable.
