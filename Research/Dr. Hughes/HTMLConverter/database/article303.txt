   According to a forthcoming study in the INFORMS journal
   Marketing Science online display ads can increase both online
   and offline retail sales, providing valuable insight for future
   marketing decisions.

   The study titled "When Less is More: Data and Power in
   Advertising Experiments" was authored by Garrett Johnson of the
   University of Rochester, Randall Lewis of Netflix, and David
   Reiley of Pandora, who were all conducting research for Yahoo!
   at the time of the study.

   The Yahoo! researchers worked with an unnamed national apparel
   retailer to evaluate the effects of the retailer's advertising.
   They collaborated on a large-scale field experiment involving
   over 3 million Yahoo! users. For two weeks, Yahoo! users in the
   experiment's treatment group saw branded apparel ads from the
   retailer whereas users in the control group saw ads for Yahoo!
   Search. Relative to the baseline established by the control
   group, the experiment showed that the retailer's campaign
   increased sales by 3.6 percent or roughly three times the
   retailer's spending on ads.

   Reiley said, "This apparel retailer approached us with an
   interesting problem: 'How do I know if my online ads work when
   90 percent of my sales are offline?'"

   The authors attacked this problem by matching customer records
   between the retailer and Yahoo!. Importantly, the authors
   combined customer-level online and offline sales data with a
   controlled experiment that allowed them to assess how much the
   consumers would have purchased in the absence of the ad
   campaign. They determined that 84 percent of the sales increase
   from the ads came from offline sales. Reiley added, "Without
   the experiment, the retailer could have erroneously concluded
   that the ads only increased online sales and not offline sales.
   Ironically, this could have led to underinvestment in online
   advertising."

   The study notes that their novel experimental design can be
   valuable for companies seeking to measure advertising
   effectiveness. Lewis noted, "We'd run experiments with this
   retailer before, but this was the largest experiment where we
   used 'control ads' to determine which control-group members
   would have seen the ads. This allowed us to ignore statistical
   noise from the purchases of consumers who never saw the ads. We
   also discovered that we only needed to look at sales after the
   first ad because an ad can only affect you after you have seen
   it. These two tricks allowed us to improve the statistical
   precision of the estimated benefits from online advertising."

   The improvement in precision from using control ads is
   critically important for managers making advertising decisions.
   Johnson explained, "Ad effectiveness estimates tend to be
   small, but also imprecise. Even with a study of 3 million
   users, standard methods to improve precision by controlling for
   customer's past behavior and demographics were less effective
   than most expected. However, by making full use of the control
   ads, we further improved by six times the statistical precision
   of our ad effects estimates. For managers, this improvement
   could be the deciding factor in learning whether online
   advertising has a clear and statistically significant positive
   impact. We hope the ideas in our design can help firms invest
   confidently in ad campaigns when they are likely to be
   profitable."
