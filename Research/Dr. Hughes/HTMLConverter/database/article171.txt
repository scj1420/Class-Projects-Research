   Welcome to The Riddler. Every week, I offer up a problem
   related to the things we hold dear around here: math, logic and
   probability. These problems, puzzles and riddles come from lots
   of top-notch puzzle folks around the world ‚Äî including you!
   You‚Äôll find this week‚Äôs puzzle below.

   Mull it over on your commute, dissect it on your lunch break
   and argue about it with your friends and lovers. When you‚Äôre
   ready, submit your answer using the link below. I‚Äôll reveal the
   solution next week, and a correct submission (chosen at random)
   will earn a shoutout in this column. Important small print: To
   be eligible, I need to receive your correct answer before 11:59
   p.m. EDT on Sunday ‚Äî have a great weekend!

   Before we get to the new puzzle, let‚Äôs return to [19]last
   week‚Äôs. Congratulations to üëè Nathan Rooy üëè of Cincinnati, our
   big winner. You can find a solution to the previous Riddler at
   the bottom of this post.


   Now here‚Äôs this week‚Äôs Riddler, a pub game puzzle that comes to
   us from James Cherry, an electrical engineer from Waterloo,
   Ontario.
     __________________________________________________________

   Consider a hot new bar game. It‚Äôs played with a coin, between
   you and a friend, on a [20]number line stretching from negative
   infinity to positive infinity. (It‚Äôs a very, very long bar.)
   You are assigned a winning number, the negative integer -X, and
   your friend is assigned his own winning number, a positive
   integer, +Y. A marker is placed at zero on the number line.
   Then the coin is repeatedly flipped. Every time the coin lands
   heads, the marker is moved one integer in a positive direction.
   Every time the coin lands tails, the marker moves one integer
   in a negative direction. You win if the coin reaches -X first,
   while your friend wins if the coin reaches +Y first. (Winner
   keeps the coin.)


   How long can you expect to sit, flipping a coin, at the bar?
   Put another way, what is the expected number of coin flips in a
   complete game?

   [24]Last week‚Äôs Riddler concerned an archvillain who was
   slicing the pentagonal Riddler headquarters in half with a
   powerful laser. To recap the details: In-house mathematicians
   were tasked with moving sensitive riddling equipment to the
   safer locations in the headquarters. Your job was to identify
   those parts of the building that were at especially high risk
   of being zapped and, for extra credit, to calculate their area.
   Our solution comes to us from an anonymous philosopher.


   The solution put simply: Keep away from the center! The
   pentagon‚Äôs area [25]bisectors intersect near that point,
   raising the odds that central regions will be zapped. The
   perimeter is safest, and if archvillain Laser Larry randomizes
   his laser attack uniformly over perimeter points rather than
   angle, the middles of the sides are the safest of the safe.


   For an even-sided regular polygon, such as a square, all area
   bisectors intersect at the center point itself, making it the
   most dangerous place, and danger decreases with distance from
   it. But for an odd-sided polygon, such as our pentagon, the
   most dangerous places are still where bisectors intersect, but
   it is not true that all bisectors intersect at a single point.
   That‚Äôs where things get interesting.

   When we examine all the possible paths along which Laser Larry
   might slice our building in half, some especially dangerous
   points emerge that take the shape of a curvy star. These are
   the points that are sliced by multiple possible laser
   bisectors. It looks like this:

   Steer clear of the curvy star.

   For much, much more on the deep math underlying this problem,
   and methods to calculate the area of the star-shaped danger
   zone, see the rest of the [31]full solution provided by the
   anonymous philosopher. (Editor‚Äôs warning: The solution is
   exhaustive, to say the least, and [32]corybantic, to say the
   most, and you certainly needn‚Äôt have worked out all its pieces
   to answer the problem correctly. But the puzzle is so cool and
   rich I‚Äôve included it all there for the riddling record.) For
   some other takes, see these analyses from our winner,
   [33]Nathan, and from [34]Laurent Lessard.
