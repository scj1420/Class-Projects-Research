   the year. Celebrate by befriending a perfect number

   You may know tomorrow, June 28, as [36]Tau Day, a celebration
   of the number 2π, which some people believe to be
   the [37]superior circle constant. I prefer to observe the[38]
   most mathematically perfect day of the year, if for no other
   reason than the fact that it works whether you prefer to write
   your dates as dd/mm or mm/dd.


   June 28 is a [39]perfect date because 6 and 28 are both
   [40]perfect numbers, numbers whose divisors add up to
   themselves. The numbers 1, 2, and 3 are the three divisors of 6
   (other than 6 itself) and 1+2+3=6. Likewise, 28=1+2+4+7+14.


   Euclid's Elements contains the [41]first known theorem about
   perfect numbers. It says that if 2^n-1 is prime, then
   (2^n-1)×2^n-1 is a perfect number. So 6 is (2^2-1)×2^2-1, or
   3×2; 28 is (2^3-1)×2^3-1, or 7×4. Prime numbers of the
   form 2^n-1, the numbers that generate these perfect numbers,
   are called Mersenne primes after the 17th-century French priest
   and math enthusiast [42]Marin Mersenne. Almost all of the
   [43]largest known prime numbers are Mersenne primes because
   they’re easier to find than other primes.


   Euclid knew that every Mersenne prime gave us an even perfect
   number, but it also goes the other way: all even perfect
   numbers must come from Mersenne primes. This theorem was
   finally proved by Euler, and it's called the [44]Euclid-Euler
   theorem, possibly maximizing the chronological distance between
   a theorem's eponyms. The [45]odd perfect numbers are more
   mysterious. We haven’t found any yet, and if we do find one, it
   will have to be [46]greater than 10^1500, but you never know
   what might be lurking around the corner.


   Another mystery is whether there are infinitely many Mersenne
   primes, and therefore infinitely many perfect numbers, or if
   the Mersenne primes dry up somewhere down the number line,
   leaving us with only finitely many points of perfection.

   For the time being, we’ve only found 49 Mersenne primes, so we
   know exactly 49 perfect numbers. On June 28, [47]find one of
   those numbers. Get to know it. Appreciate its exponents, make
   friends with its factors.


   You can start small, getting cozy with one of the perfect
   numbers Euclid knew: 6, 28, 496, or 8128. Or you can reach for
   the stars and adopt the latest, greatest perfect number
   (2^74,207,281-1)×2^74,207,280, with its 44,677,235 digits, as
   your friend for the day.

   There are [48]49 choices. Make yours count.
