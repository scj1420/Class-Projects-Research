   This is the first article in an occasional series,
   [29]Premonitions of Disaster, on the lives of German Jews in
   the 1920s and 1930s. Abraham Fraenkel was born in Germany in
   1891, and died in Israel in 1965, aged 74.
   His [30]Recollections of a Jewish Mathematician in Germany were
   reissued last year by Springer.



   My report about this last phase of my life in Germany should
   not close without my describing some people who in every
   respect deserve to be highlighted. Those who first come to mind
   are eight scientists. Of course, I cannot and do not wish to
   offer biographies or acknowledgments of their scientific
   accomplishments that can be easily found elsewhere. Instead, I
   will mention primarily those aspects that were significant for
   my own development. Of these eight men, there are four
   mathematicians: Hilbert, Brouwer, Landau, and von Neumann; two
   physicists: Einstein and Niels Bohr; and two Protestant
   theologians and philosophers: Rudolf Otto and Heinrich Scholz.

   In his time David Hilbert (1862–1943) was the most significant
   mathematician in the world. For a long time, he shared this
   honor with Henri Poincaré, who died in 1912. In contrast to
   most of his colleagues, Hilbert’s discoveries in successive
   periods encompassed the broadest range of pure mathematics. He
   hardly dealt with applied mathematics, except for one not very
   successful period devoted to physics. He was born in Königsberg
   and never relinquished his East Prussian accent. The number of
   true anecdotes about him is legion, as he was, without doubt, a
   highly original character. He became a professor in Göttingen
   in 1895 and declined appointments to Leipzig, Berlin,
   Heidelberg, and in 1919 to Bern. He was correctly considered
   the scientific head of German mathematics, and was acknowledged
   throughout the world. Students flocked to him from all over
   Europe and the United States. At the second International
   Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900 he gave a
   programmatic lecture on “Mathematical Problems.” The 23 key
   unsolved problems he enumerated largely determined the
   developments in mathematics in the subsequent decades. Most of
   these problems have since been solved, problem No. 1 by Paul J.
   Cohen in 1963.

   Hilbert always remained free of all national and racist
   prejudices. After the turn of the 20th century, he had a large
   number of Jewish students, both in absolute and relative terms.
   In his own working life, he was greatly influenced by two Jews,
   Adolf Hurwitz and Hermann Minkowski. His authority and tenacity
   managed twice to break through the prewar prejudice in the
   Prussian Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs against
   appointing Jews to full professorships: Minkowski in 1902 and
   Landau in 1909. He pushed through the postdoctoral professorial
   qualification (Habilitation) granted Emmy Noether at the
   University of Göttingen despite the resistance of many
   colleagues, including some Jews, although this resistance was
   chiefly directed to her being a woman, rather than on account
   of her being a Jew and salon communist. Hilbert’ s response to
   a question of Bernhard Rust, the Nazi Reich Minister for
   Science, Education, and Popular Culture, was typical. At a
   banquet in 1934 in Göttingen, Rust asked: “Is it really true,
   Mr. Professor, that your institute suffered so much from the
   departure of the Jews and their friends?” to which Hilbert
   replied, in his characteristic East Prussian dialect:
   “Suffered? No, it hasn’t suffered, Mr. Minister. It simply
   doesn’t exist anymore!”

   I never studied in Göttingen so I was never actually a student
   of Hilbert. It is thanks to a fortuitous occurrence that I
   nevertheless had the opportunity to develop a close
   relationship with him. His last creative period, starting in
   1918, was dedicated to axiomatics and the foundation of
   mathematics in general. Totally unrelated to that, in 1921, I
   had taken on the axiomatics of set theory, the fundamental
   discipline of mathematics, to which Hilbert had always attached
   great significance, and whose creator, Georg Cantor, he had
   defended against harsh criticism. Hilbert’ s highly talented
   assistant and close collaborator Paul Bernays (descendant of
   the famous Hamburg Talmud scholar Chacham [Isaac] Bernays)—who
   taught at the Swiss Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich
   starting in 1933—focused as of 1935 specifically on set theory.
   As a result of my own engagement with set theory, Hilbert asked
   me in 1922 to give lectures at the Göttingen Mathematical
   Society. A relentless and yet objective critic on such
   occasions, he must have been impressed with my results, because
   he offered me warm praise. Our further communication took place
   mostly in writing. Although he had accepted my invitation to
   hold a lecture in Kiel, due to external circumstances this did
   not come to pass. After the third edition of my Einleitung in
   die Mengenlehre (Foundations of Set Theory) was published, I
   received a very cordial handwritten letter of thanks. Not until
   much later did I learn that he had considerable influence on my
   receiving the appointment in 1928 as a full professor in Kiel,
   since the Ministry had sought his opinion on the various
   candidates.

   L.E.J. Brouwer [1881–1966] of Holland can be viewed as the
   decided adversary of Hilbert. His mathematical merits are
   limited to two—to be sure, very important— achievements. He
   mastered, especially from 1911 to 1914, certain difficult
   topographical problems that have to do with the concept of
   dimension; however, this was the virtual extent of his actual
   mathematical work. But even earlier, and also in the years
   1918–1930, he had developed an original doctrine in an
   ultradogmatic manner that he referred to as “intuitionism,” and
   later “neointuitionism,” in which he rejected the greatest part
   of “classical” mathematics of the last three centuries as well
   as “classical” (Aristotelian) logic, with the argument that
   these were in part meaningless and in part incorrect teachings,
   since they were based in particular on “existence” rather than
   “construction.”

   His standpoint was rejected by the overwhelming majority of
   mathematicians and logicians. His discussions with Hilbert, in
   particular, assumed a personal note. The two virtually drowned
   one another with their cursing. The dispute took on a
   particular nuance in the sense that the Dutchman Brouwer set
   himself up as a champion of Aryan Germanness. Consequently,
   Hilbert removed him from the editorial board of the
   Mathematische Annalen after he objected to what he felt were
   too many Eastern European Jewish (“Ostjuden”) authors. In 1922
   he published a 16-page Open Letter of protest to the Dutch
   Minister of Education for allowing the outstanding French
   scholar Arnaud Denjoy, who was professor at the University of
   Utrecht and a member of the Amsterdam Academy of Sciences, to
   maintain a “corresponding membership” although Denjoy conducted
   himself, according to Brouwer, like an “agent for the French
   government.” Brouwer also openly protested against
   participating in the International Congress of Mathematicians
   in Bologna in 1928, claiming that the many German scholars, who
   under Hilbert’s leadership participated in the Congress along
   with the French, had sinned against the “Manes of Gauss and
   Riemann.” Luckily, his instinct saved him—in contrast, mutatis
   mutandis, to another outstanding Dutch mathematician—from
   accepting a position at the University of Berlin, which the
   Nazis offered him in 1933.

   I often got together with Brouwer, especially in Amsterdam, and
   was among the first mathematicians outside of Holland who
   treated his intuitionist views in lectures, articles, and books
   in a non-dogmatic, often critical form. At first, Brouwer was
   enthusiastic in his praise of me, but I later became the object
   of his passionate and grievous rejection. My presentations of
   intuitionism were the earliest, but by no means the most
   in-depth. Starting in 1930 many esteemed mathematicians from
   Holland, the United States, and other countries distilled from
   Brouwer’s ideas all that made sense and lacked dogmatic
   prejudice, and was insightful and sometimes groundbreaking also
   in classical mathematics.

   Brouwer was temporarily suspended in 1945 by the Dutch
   government because of his connections to the Nazis, especially
   during the German occupation of Holland, when the Dutch Jews
   suffered extremely cruel treatment and most were exterminated
   in camps, but he later regained his position. I found it
   impossible to resume our former friendly relations.

   Edmund Landau (1877–1938) can also be described as an original
   sort of character. Starting in the 1920s he took on the middle
   name “Yechezkel,” after the Prague rabbi and Talmudist
   Yechezkel Landau, whose brother was an ancestor of his. Edmund
   Landau’ s father was the well-known Berlin gynecologist
   Professor Leopold Landau, who, after originally being rather
   distant to Judaism, later espoused the national-Jewish stance
   and supported the cause of the Palestine/land of Israel Jewish
   Colonization Association (PICA). He proudly showed me Hebrew
   inscriptions in the courtyard of his mansion near Berlin’s
   Pariser Platz.

   Landau was one of the most prolific scientists of his time.
   From 1904 to 1909 alone he published more than 50 papers, some
   of which were very extensive, and a two-volume, innovative book
   on the distribution of prime numbers. His main areas of
   research were the theory of functions and analytical number
   theory. He worked together with the outstanding English
   mathematicians G.H. Hardy and John Edensor Littlewood, with
   Harald Bohr, the brother of Niels Bohr, and many others. Over
   time he developed an increasingly concise, concentrated style
   of writing, not only in his papers but also in his books,
   totally erasing the intuitive dimension of his mathematical
   problem-solving—in a tradition first introduced by Gauss. Not
   everyone likes this style, especially when dealing with such
   difficult subjects. Apart from that, he did not lack a sense of
   humor, as demonstrated by his prefaces to Foundations of
   Analysis, which was widely read in both German and English.

   In 1899 Landau completed his doctorate and in 1901, at 24, his
   postdoctoral professorial qualification, both at the University
   of Berlin. After the premature death of Minkowski, Hilbert
   wanted a first-class successor, from whom he anticipated
   creative talents. And so it happened that in 1909, Landau, at
   32 years of age, received the important Göttingen professorial
   position, in every sense an unusual appointment, skipping the
   then usual intermediate step of nontenured associate professor
   (Extraordinarius). He was very successful as a teacher in
   Göttingen and attracted doctoral candidates from all over the
   world. His relationship to Hilbert, however, turned out not to
   be as agreeable as had been expected. After Felix Klein (dubbed
   the “foreign minister of mathematics”) retired, Hilbert
   appointed the Jewish mathematical analyst Richard Courant as
   his successor; Courant is credited especially for the
   establishment of Göttingen’s prestigious Mathematical Institute
   after the First World War, with funding from the United States.
   In 1933 special efforts were made to try to keep him, but he
   was lucky to soon receive an academically and administratively
   more outstanding position at New York University.

   Landau’s avid wish to receive a professorship in Berlin did not
   come true. His quirky nature had made him many enemies,
   especially Ludwig Bieberbach, who had enjoyed a full
   professorship in Berlin since 1921. By virtue of his parents’
   and his brother-in-law Paul Ehrlich’ s assets, Landau was a
   wealthy man. He built a mansion-like home in Göttingen to house
   his huge scientific library. As a guest, I often had the chance
   to admire his lavishly designed home. Aside from mathematical
   research, to which Landau was dedicated with untiring
   diligence, he had two hobbies: He owned an extensive and
   probably valuable postage-stamp collection, which he constantly
   expanded, and in his free time he read detective stories with a
   passion.

   After the founding of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in
   1925 with initially three institutes, it seemed natural that a
   chair should also be established for mathematics, a science
   often characterized as “Jewish.” In addition to the two
   world-famous mathematicians Jacques Hadamard and Edmund Landau,
   the university’ s Board of Governors also included Selig
   Brodetsky who in 1924 had taken up a position as professor of
   applied mathematics at the University of Leeds and who as a
   Zionist leader had rendered great service to the university. At
   first Einstein was also a member, but he soon withdrew from the
   Board of Governors. Shortly after the 14th Zionist Congress in
   Vienna, the Board of Governors of the Hebrew University met in
   September 1925 in the home of Dr. Elias Straus in Munich. On
   the agenda was also the question of the appointment of a
   mathematics chair. As I remember, it was the last (or even the
   only) session in which Einstein participated. I was also in
   Munich at the time, at my father’s deathbed, and Landau visited
   me. Obviously, there was a proposal that Landau go to Jerusalem
   either temporarily or long-term. He was in fact offered the
   position and was prepared to accept it. Although he had not
   been raised close to Jewish tradition, much less Hebrew
   scripture, he made an effort in his usual energetic fashion to
   learn Hebrew and managed amazingly quickly to master the
   language, especially to speak it fluently. And so he went to
   Jerusalem in the fall of 1927 as the first professor of
   mathematics. Supported by associate professor Dr. Benjamin
   Amira, who was raised in Palestine/Land of Israel and had
   completed his doctorate at the University of Geneva, Landau
   successfully taught the eager students for the duration of the
   semester.

   This is not the place to discuss the differences that arose
   between Landau, the university management, and the Board of
   Governors. In any case, Landau left Jerusalem at the end of the
   winter semester and never returned. Thus the Board, when it
   convened again in June 1928 in London, had once again to place
   the appointment of the mathematics chair on the agenda.

   Edmund Landau had also paid attention to my prewar publications
   and followed my work from the early 1920s even more closely,
   although it was in a field that was relatively unrelated to
   his. In 1927, when I was still a non-tenured associate
   professor (Extraordinarius) in Marburg, he had already spoken
   with me somewhat tentatively of his intention to suggest me to
   the Board of Governors for the professorial chair in Jerusalem.
   I did not take him too seriously, especially when I heard that
   Hadamard wanted to suggest the distinguished Polish-French
   analyst Szolem Mandelbrojt; besides that, Landau’ s own
   decisions before he left for Jerusalem were anything but firm.
   Thus it was a great surprise for me when on June 5, 1928, in
   Kiel, only a few weeks after I assumed my position there, I
   received a telegram from London offering me the chair in
   Jerusalem. As Landau later explained to me, Mandelbrojt had
   decided not to leave France, so his candidacy had never even
   been considered. And he did, in fact, receive a position in
   Paris a short time later, as Hadamard’s successor at the
   Collège de France. My appointment had been unanimous, with even
   the approval of the physicist on the Board of Governors,
   Leonard S. Ornstein from the Netherlands.

   Landau’s and my relationship became increasingly close in those
   years, encouraged by his growing competence in Hebrew. He even
   sent me telegrams in Hebrew from Göttingen to Marburg! My last
   encounter with Landau was in Switzerland shortly after the
   Nazis came to power. In contrast to Courant, he was not
   frightened, but rather filled with an incomprehensible
   optimism. But the blow came soon— even sooner for him than for
   other Jewish professors. The Göttingen students demonstrated
   against him—evidently having been incited from higher up—and
   demanded his dismissal. A certain lecture sheds light on the
   background to this “resolute rejection” of Landau. It was held
   by Berlin professor Ludwig Bieberbach in spring 1934 in Berlin
   at the annual conference of the Verein zur Förderung des
   mathematischen und naturwissenschaftlichen Unterrichts. The
   press, for example, the Deutsche Zukunft (German Future) of
   April 8, 1934, and Forschungen und Fortschritte (Research and
   Progress) of June 20, 1934, gave extensive coverage of the
   lecture. Cited here are some passages from it:

     The conduct of the Göttingen students toward Edmund Landau
     is well-founded and justified, as the Landau case clearly
     shows that there is a German and a Jewish mathematics, two
     worlds, separated by an unbridgeable chasm. The selection of
     the problems and the style of treating them is
     characteristic of the thinker and therefore a product of his
     racial affiliation. … A people that has come into its own
     cannot tolerate such teachers and must reject foreign
     thought.

   Bieberbach then made reference to the psychological typology of
   Erich Jaensch, assigning the abstracting S type to the Jews and
   speakers of Romance languages, and that of the J type, which
   seeks to understand reality in all its manifold aspects, to the
   Germans. He remarked on the explication of imaginary numbers by
   Cauchy and Goursat (both of whom are not Jews!):

     The Cauchy-Goursat theorem arouses intolerable displeasure
     in us Germans. But certainly not in a Landau. Such a thing
     is mentally determined. … All in all, such juggling with
     concepts and a pronounced shrewdness characterize the
     nonorganic, hostile S type, especially Jewish mathematics.

   This was then compared to the “Eastphalian” Gauss, the
   “Nordic-Dinaric” Felix Klein, and the “Eastern Baltic–Nordic”
   Hilbert:

     Abstract Jewish thinkers of the S type knew how to deform
     [the axiomatics of Hilbert], so that they can be used as
     intellectual varieté. … This is a typical example of how
     race-alien influences and race-alien seduction blocks the
     Germans from the source of their own strength. … There is no
     self-sufficient mathematical domain that is independent of
     ideology and life; the dispute on the fundamental principles
     that is now raging is in reality a dispute over race.

   The journal Deutsche Zukunft drew its own conclusions:

     For practical cultural policy it turns out that mathematics
     is freed from the curse of sterile intellectualism; its
     burden falls upon those thinkers who are alien to the nation
     and the race, who will no longer exist in the future and
     whose representatives belong to the past and can no longer
     be viewed as German scientists. German mathematics is rooted
     in blood and soil.…

   These statements caused incredible outrage abroad, perhaps more
   than did the brutal dismissal of Landau himself and all the
   Jewish and “half-Jewish” scholars in Germany. In a letter to
   Bieberbach of May 19, 1934, one of the most eminent American
   mathematicians, Professor Oswald Veblen of the Institute for
   Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, expressed his disgust
   at the distinctions made between Jewish and German mathematics
   and at such pseudo-scientific justification of the measures
   taken against Landau, “one of the great mathematicians of our
   epoch.” He added that the article in Deutsche Zukunft was
   received in the United States “with varying degrees of sorrow,
   derision, and contempt.” Veblen had written this letter in an
   outburst of pure humanitarianism, without having been able at
   the time to foresee that the expulsion of all “non-Aryan”
   scholars from Germany, and later also from Austria, would make
   the hospitable United States (together with Russia) into the
   center of the world for mathematics and physics, even before
   the end of the 1930s, particularly in view of modern nuclear
   physics.

   The consequences of this shift are generally known. After
   losing his professorial chair in Göttingen, Landau moved to
   Berlin. Although he also went abroad to give lectures, he never
   managed to decide to emigrate, which would have meant losing
   all his assets. He died in 1938 at the age of only 61.
