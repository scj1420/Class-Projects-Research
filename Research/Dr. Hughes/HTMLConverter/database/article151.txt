   Statistics teaches that if a coin lands on head 100 times in a
   row, it's still equally likely to land on head and and tail the
   101th time. But wouldn't such as sequence suggest the coin
   likely isn't fair?

   Image Post[121]For Richard Guy's 100th birthday, here's a photo
   of him walking to the top of Calgary Tower earlier this year.

   If you're into Conway's Life game, this is the guy who

   I am into Conway's Life game (programmed my own version in VBA
   for fun at work one day). So cool to put a face to one of the
   components.

   He did a presentation at my school a few weeks ago. Pretty neat
   guy. To put his age in perspective, he attended the University
   of Cambridge with G. H. Hardy.

   Do you mean The University of Cambridge or is there an American
   university called Cambridge School?

   I'm not trying to be a twat, There's a University of York in
   the UK and a York University in Canada so these things can be
   confusing, and I know there's a place in America called
   Cambridge.

   G.H. Hardy went to the University of Cambridge so it was pretty
   clear.

   He would occasionally stop by the math nights for kids when I
   was in junior high- always took the stairs to the fourth floor
   without fail. Inspiring guy.

   Wow. Good for him. I'm 24 and I'd give up after 20 stairs.

   It is therefore logical that you will be able to make it up all
   800 stairs by age 960!

   That's assuming I go 5/6 of a stair per year.

   No, just that you can climb 5/6 more stairs every year.
