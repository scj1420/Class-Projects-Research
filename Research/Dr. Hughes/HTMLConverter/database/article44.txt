Tsunami simulator recreates devastating waves for first time in a lab

   “It’s horrible in that the more tired they get it’s getting
   colder and literally more difficult for them to move the
   molasses,” said Sharp.

   Leading up to the disaster, there had been a cold snap in
   Boston and temperatures were as low as -16C (3F). The steel
   tank in the harbour, which had been built half as thick as
   model specifications, had already been showing signs of strain.

   Two days before the disaster the tank was about 70% full, when
   a fresh shipment of warm molasses arrived from the Caribbean
   and the tank was filled to the top.

   “One of the things people described would happen whenever they
   had a new molasses shipment was that the tank would rumble and
   groan,” said Sharp. “People described being unnerved by the
   noises the tank would make after it got filled.”

   Ominously, the tank had also been leaking, which the company
   responded to by painting the tank brown.

   “There were a lot of bad signs in this,” said Sharp.

   Sharp, and a team of scientists at Harvard University,
   performed experiments in a large refrigerator to model how corn
   syrup (standing in for molasses) behaves as temperature varies,
   confirming contemporary accounts of the disaster.

   “Historical estimates said that the initial wave would have
   moved at 56km/h [35mph],” said Sharp. “When we take models ...
   and then we put in the parameters for molasses, we get numbers
   that are on a par with that. Horses weren’t able to run away
   from it. Horses and people and everything were all caught up in
   it.”

   The giant molasses wave follows the physical laws of a
   phenomenon known as a gravity current, in which a dense fluid
   expands mostly horizontally into a less dense fluid. “It’s what
   lava flows are, it’s what avalanches are, it’s that awful
   draught that comes underneath your door in the wintertime,”
   said Sharp.
