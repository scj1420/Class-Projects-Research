These adorable wooly math projects will make you want to learn to
knit

   Higher mathematics are hard. Yarn is soft. And in most cases,
   these two things would remain separated — after all, how could
   concepts like a [68]pursuit curve or [69]circle ratios possibly
   relate to making a scarf?

   Pat Ashforth and Steve Plummer are two British math teachers
   who have been trying to answer questions like that for the last
   20 years with their mathematical knitting projects. Together,
   the pair goes by [70]Woolly Thoughts, and their site features a
   wide array of [71]afghans, [72]cushions, [73]scarfs,
   and [74]plush toys that visually express different mathematical
   ideas in brightly colored (and incredibly comfortable-looking)
   ways.

   But more importantly, Woolly Thoughts [75]sells most of their
   knitting and crocheting patterns. So you don't just have to
   admire their Fibonacci sequence throw blanket, you can actually
   make your own. And while I have approximately zero idea of how
   to knit or crochet, with winter rapidly approaching, now feels
   like the perfect time to swing by a craft store, break out some
   yarn and needles, and start work on my own Penrose triangle
   blanket.

   Or maybe some hexaflexagon thrown cushions!

   Who knows? Maybe you’ll even learn some math along the way. And
   you can read more Ashforth and Plummer's history of
   mathematical knitting over in [76]their interview with The
   Guardian.
