   Google built a multi-billion dollar business based on its
   ability to weigh site authority. Search and autocomplete are so
   seamlessly intuitive that most of us couldn’t imagine using the
   web any other way. But some groups have been tricking the
   system to boost misinformation in search rankings. And we all
   know how that turned out.

   The problem seems to be that Google’s search algorithm is
   designed to find and promote what’s popular online. While this
   works well to promote a popular local service (like barber
   shops and restaurants), it’s not really helpful when it comes
   to disseminating news. The algorithm [129]seems to be promoting
   information that is simple not true. If you don’t think so,
   trying doing a search for “climate change is…” and see what you
   come up with.


   Google isn’t the only tech company to face increased scrutiny
   over the way its algorithms work. [130]Facebook faced similar
   criticism earlier when the public realized its role in helping
   misinformation spread during the 2016 US presidential campaign.
   The social media giant has been accused of unknowingly helping
   build support for websites that are filled with misinformation.
   Meanwhile, communication experts and data scientists claim some
   groups have found creative ways to [131]manipulate social media
   trends.


   Neither Google nor Facebook has made their search algorithms
   public. In the past, when research groups found weaknesses in
   the algorithmic search system, Google could adjust the system
   manually. But this process has never been transparent and the
   company has never before been held accountable for a bias in
   the system.

   These manipulations could have an impact on the way searchers
   perceive the world around them. Constant exposure to fake news
   influences the way people think about social issues and even
   play a role in the way they vote. Researchers from the
   [132]American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology
   found that undecided voters could be greatly influenced by
   manipulating search rankings. In other words, Google and other
   tech giants that control search engines could have the power to
   rig an election.


   After the update on Google’s search algorithm last year, fake
   news sites are increasingly outranking accurate reports on
   high-quality websites. This is due to the algorithm’s
   inclination to reward search results based on the user’s
   likeliness to click on them. Because of this,
   Google’s-autocomplete suggestions now predict that you are
   searching for fake news even when you might not intend to do
   so.

   There has also been a widespread misconception that the spread
   of fake news is all Facebook’s fault. However, social shares,
   likes, and tweets don’t account for Google’s ranking algorithm.
   It’s true that fake news has emerged as a serious problem on
   Facebook recently, but that problem and Google algorithm’s
   higher ranking of fake news results are separate problems.

   Google admits that its autocomplete and search algorithms are
   not an ‘[133]exact science.’ These systems are a combination of
   personalized search results and a [134]variety of secret
   factors that are used to weigh a website’s importance. The
   company has made efforts in the past to reduce the way these
   systems weigh porn, hate speech, and offensive terms. The
   heated debate around fake news has already pushed Facebook to
   [135]improve its algorithm. Hopefully, Google will follow suit
   soon.
