[45]Scientists Have a Crazy Hunch About Why the Sun Is Spinning Too
Slowly


   Physicists have long known that the Sun spins, like the Earth.
   But a few decades ago, they realized …

   What would even produce these magnetic Rossby waves? “Rossby
   waves are observed in planetary atmospheres partly because the
   interaction of the fluid that makes up the atmosphere with
   land,” Mitzi Adams, NASA solar astronomer, told Gizmodo. “On
   the sun, of course, there is no solid surface” for the outer
   levels to interact with. The waves, Adams suggested, could
   result from the outermost layer of the Sun interacting with the
   layer beneath, but scientists will need to do more modeling
   work to be certain.

   Kuhn and Adams both agreed that we need more data.
   Unforutnately, that won’t be possible for a long time. The key
   to making an observation like this was the Earth-orbiting Solar
   Dynamics Observatory, along with the Sun-orbiting STEREO
   satellites, which let scientists observe the Sun from all sides
   at the same time. But NASA lost contact with STERO-B, the
   satellite on the opposite side of the Sun, in 2014. It regained
   contact briefly in September 2016, but [47]hasn’t had contact
   with the spacecraft since then (although it’s still trying).


   That hasn’t stopped McIntosh’s team from making and testing
   predictions about the Sun’s activity using his observations and
   theory. They think these Rossby waves could be used to foretell
   coming sunspots and increasing solar activity levels, which
   could lead to an uptick in space weather here on Earth. One
   paper accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal
   (pre-print [48]here) demonstrates that McIntosh and his
   colleagues successfully forecast some of the Sun’s magnetic
   activity in predictions [49]published several years ago. Their
   new paper also predicts the behavior of solar cycle 25, the
   next cycle in a pattern of solar magnetic activity that repeats
   itself every 11 years, and that’s expected to begin anew in
   2019.

   And McIntosh’s solar weather predictions involving Rossby wave
   observations really do seem so be working.

   “So far, everything is behaivng exactly the way we expected it
   to,” McIntosh said, noting that his team has correctly called
   out flares in solar behavior and predicted that the current
   solar cycle would have less activity than average. “We said
   we’d see a solar minimum soon, and that new sunspots would show
   up in 2019. Everything seems to be tracking perfectly,” he
   said. “But whether we’re lucky or actually tracking something,
   that’s up to other people.”

   The results have plenty of other implications besides space
   weather predicting. Rossby waves on the Sun might mean other
   stars also have temporary clusters of bright points that
   traverse the surface with regularity. “One might mistake [a
   star with Rossby waves] to be a planet of some distance,” said
   Orkan Umurhan, a research scientist at the NASA Ames Research
   Center. He thought that some of the distant exoplanets
   scientists have catalogued might actually just be Rossby waves
   on those stars. “There’s going to be interest from the
   astronomers as well for this reason.”

   The ultimate goal is to use these observations to forecast
   sunspots and flares in solar behavior with more than a few
   hours of lead time, allowing NASA to rotate satellites to
   minimize damage, or helping us prepare for a [51]potential
   power outage. McIntosh will continue making predictions and
   hoping they play out as he expects. He’s confident about his
   observations, but definitely needs more data, which will
   require more satellites. “I’ve been working on this for 15
   years but that doesn’t mean that it’s right,” he said.
