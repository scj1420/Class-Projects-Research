   Most of the books that we cover here at [310]MAA Reviews deal
   with mathematics that was done decades, if not centuries, ago
   rather than being truly contemporary. There is good reason for
   that, as it can be difficult to write a good book about a topic
   until it is clear how it fits into the bigger picture of the
   discipline, what applications it might have, and even what
   terminology and notation the community will eventually settle
   on. When books are written about contemporary topics, they tend
   to be dense monographs intended for specialists in the area
   rather than expository books written for graduate students, or
   even undergraduates.


   While there are good reasons that authors often don’t try to
   convey new ideas to more general audiences, Larry Guth’s new
   book, Polynomial Methods in Combinatorics is the exception that
   proves the rule. In this volume, he attempts to take a very
   modern area of mathematics — roughly described as the
   intersection of geometric combinatorics and harmonic analysis —
   where research is being actively done by some of the top
   mathematicians in the world, and write about it in a way that
   is accessible to advanced undergraduate students. And he
   succeeds marvelously. His book is essentially a treatise on
   polynomials, and how a close look at certain polynomials can be
   used to answer deep and exciting questions in algebraic
   geometry and combinatorics.

   To illustrate this idea, the book starts by stating the
   [311]finite field Kakeya problem: Given a finite field
   \(\mathbb{F}_q\), what is the smallest set of points \(K\) in
   \(\mathbb{F}_q^n\) so that \(K\) contains a line in every
   direction? In 2009, Dvir showed that this set \(K\) must
   contain at least \((10n)^{-n}q^n\) points. While the problem as
   stated sounds like a geometric problem, Dvir’s approach was
   actually algebraic in nature, as he considered the properties
   of the lowest degree polynomial that vanishes on all of the
   points in \(K\).


   As another example, Guth describes the [312]Erdős distinct
   distance problem, and how he and Nets Katz have been able to
   very recently show that any set of \(n\) points in
   \(\mathbb{R}^2\) must have at least \(cn(\log(n))^{-1}\)
   distinct distances between them, for some constant \(c\).
   Again, this problem seems to be geometric in nature but their
   approach uses polynomials.


   Guth gives proofs of both of these theorems and also spends
   time discussing why more naïve approaches to them did not give
   results that were as strong as those that were achieved using
   these approaches. He then uses all of these ideas as a
   launching pad to explore a variety of areas of mathematics. The
   bulk of the book applies these ideas to the study of incidence
   geometry, which looks at the various ways that lines and
   circles intersect in the plane. One of the first results in
   this area was [313]due to Szemeredi and Trotter in the 1980s,
   and says that if you have a set of \(L\) lines in the plane
   \(\mathbb{R}^2\) then the number of points that lie on \(r\) or
   more of these points is bounded (up to a constant) by
   \(L^2r^{-3}+Lr^{-1}\). Guth’s book extends these ideas to
   higher dimensions as well as additional hypotheses: for
   example, what if you insist that some portion of your lines lie
   on a given hypersurface? Does that additional structure give
   you better bounds? Along the way to addressing all of these
   questions, Guth introduces ideas in error-correcting codes,
   algebraic geometry (Bezout’s theorem plays a particularly large
   role), polynomial partitions, ruled surface theory,
   differential geometry, and even Fourier analysis.


   A final chapter looks at applications of the polynomial method
   to questions in number theory. In particular, Guth looks at
   solutions to diophantine equations as well as Thue and Roth’s
   theorems about approximations to diophantine equations. These
   results are more classical than most of the material in the
   book (although even they only really date to the early
   twentieth century), but show that the idea of using polynomials
   throughout mathematics has a rich history.

   The ideas in Guth’s book are simultaneously very deep and very
   elementary. The book is not for the faint of heart, but at the
   same time most of the book does not require much more
   background than a good abstract algebra course along with some
   familiarity with number theory and linear algebra.

   Guth’s exposition is truly wonderful, and he has a good sense
   of when to do concrete examples and when to keep the material
   more abstract. He often goes on digressions, but they never
   feel like they take you too far off the path. There are a
   handful of exercises, so one can imagine using this book for an
   advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course, but I
   think the book will find its best audience from people who just
   want to learn about some of these recent developments in
   geometry. No matter what stage they are at, I think that anyone
   who reads this book will walk away feeling like they have a
   deeper understanding of a very exciting area of mathematics.
