   The development of statistics, probability theory, game theory
   and chaos theory owes a lot to people trying to figure out
   various games of chance.

   “It’s not just [42]gamblers using science. In many cases,
   science has benefited enormously from [43]people studying the
   house.”


   Mathematician Adam Kucharski. He’s the author of the new book
   [44]The Perfect Bet: How Science and Math Are Taking the Luck
   Out of Gambling.


   “Back in the Renaissance, actually, probability theory was
   developed to study these games. I mean, can you imagine having
   bets where it’s not actually clear what a fair game is?”

   For example, in the 17th century the question came up, do you
   have the same chance of throwing a six by rolling one die four
   times or of throwing two sixes by rolling two dice 24 times?

   “That had been around awhile, those kinds of bets and those
   kinds of questions, and that was Fermat and Pascal who
   developed a lot of this theory. And one of the crucial things
   was this concept of an expected value: if you play a game
   repeatedly what do you expect to win on average? And until you
   have that kind of theory in place it’s very hard to actually
   compare two bets directly and work out which one is more
   preferable.”

   Pascal figured out that your chances of throwing one six in
   four rolls of a die was slightly more than 50 percent. But your
   odds of two sixes in 24 throws of two dice was [45]slightly
   less than 50 percent.


   “And a lot of this theory from probability to statistics and
   actually more recently things like game theory and chaos theory
   originated with studying games of chance, so I think science
   actually has benefitted a lot from people’s curiosity about
   gambling.”

   My [46]full interview with Adam Kucharski about his book The
   Perfect Bet is at our Web site as a Science Talk podcast.
