Information Avoidance: How People Select Their Own Reality

   By [51]Shilo Rea

   We live in an unprecedented "age of information," but we use
   very little of it. Dieters prefer not to look at the calories
   in their tasty desert, people at high risk for disease avoid
   screenings and people choose the news source that aligns with
   their political ideology.

   Drawing on research in economics, psychology and sociology,
   Carnegie Mellon University's [52]George Loewenstein,
   [53]Russell Golman and [54]David Hagmann illustrate how people
   select their own reality by deliberately avoiding information
   that threatens their happiness and wellbeing.

     [52] https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/people/faculty/george-loewenstein.html
     [53] https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/people/faculty/russell-golman.html
     [54] https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/people/phdstudents/david-hagmann.html

   In a paper published in the [55]Journal of Economic Literature,
   they show that while a simple failure to obtain information is
   the most clear-cut case of "information avoidance," people have
   a wide range of other information-avoidance strategies at their
   disposal. They also are remarkably adept at selectively
   directing their attention to information that affirms what they
   believe or that reflects favorably upon them, and at forgetting
   information they wish were not true.

     [55] https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20151245

   "The standard account of information in economics is that
   people should seek out information that will aid in
   decision-making, should never actively avoid information, and
   should dispassionately update their views when they encounter
   new valid information," said Loewenstein, the Herbert A. Simon
   University Professor of Economics and Psychology who co-founded
   the field of behavioral economics.

   "But people often avoid information that could help them to
   make better decisions if they think the information might be
   painful to receive. Bad teachers, for example, could benefit
   from feedback from students, but are much less likely to pore
   over teaching ratings than skilled teachers," Loewenstein said.

   Even when people cannot outright ignore information, they often
   have substantial latitude in how to interpret it. Questionable
   evidence is often treated as credible when it confirms what
   someone wants to believe — as is the case of discredited
   research linking vaccines to autism. And evidence that meets
   the rigorous demands of science is often discounted if it goes
   against what people want to believe, as illustrated by
   widespread dismissal of scientific evidence of climate change.

   Information avoidance can be harmful, for example, when people
   miss opportunities to treat serious diseases early on or fail
   to learn about better financial investments that could prepare
   them for retirement. It also has large societal implications.

   "An implication of information avoidance is that we do not
   engage effectively with those who disagree with us," said
   Hagmann, a Ph.D. student in the [56]Department of Social and
   Decision Sciences. "Bombarding people with information that
   challenges their cherished beliefs — the usual strategy that
   people employ in attempts at persuasion - is more likely to
   engender defensive avoidance than receptive processing. If we
   want to reduce political polarization, we have to find ways not
   only to expose people to conflicting information, but to
   increase people's receptivity to information that challenges
   what they believe and want to believe."

     [56] https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/index.html

   Despite the consequences, information avoidance isn't always a
   mistake or a reflection of a lazy mind.

   "People do it for a reason," said Golman, assistant professor
   of social and decision sciences. "Those who do not take a
   genetic test can enjoy their life until their illness can't be
   ignored, an inflated sense of our own abilities can help us to
   pursue big and worthwhile goals, and not looking at our
   financial investments when markets are down may keep us from
   selling in a panic."

   The researchers believe understanding when, why and how people
   avoid information can help governments, firms and organizations
   reach their audiences effectively without drowning them in
   unwanted messages.
