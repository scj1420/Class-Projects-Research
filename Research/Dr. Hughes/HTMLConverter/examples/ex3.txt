   A federal judge in Hawaii on Wednesday issued a sweeping freeze
   of President Trump’s new executive order hours before it would
   have temporarily barred the issuance of new visas to citizens
   of six Muslim-majority countries and suspended the admission of
   new refugees.

   In a blistering 43-page opinion, U.S. District Judge Derrick K.
   Watson pointed to Trump’s own comments and those of his close
   advisers as evidence that his order was meant to discriminate
   against Muslims and declared there was a “strong likelihood of
   success” that those suing would prove the directive violated
   the Constitution.

   Watson declared that “a reasonable, objective observer —
   enlightened by the specific historical context, contemporaneous
   public statements, and specific sequence of events leading to
   its issuance — would conclude that the Executive Order was
   issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion.”

   He lambasted the government, in particular, for asserting that
   because the ban did not apply to all Muslims in the world, it
   could not be construed as discriminating against Muslims.

   What Trump changed in the new travel ban

    [182] http://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-compare-travel-ban/
    [183] http://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-compare-travel-ban/

   “The illogic of the Government’s contentions is palpable,”
   Watson wrote. “The notion that one can demonstrate animus
   toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at
   once is fundamentally flawed.”

   At a rally in Nashville, Trump called the ruling “terrible” and
   asked a cheering crowd whether the ruling was “done by a judge
   for political reasons.” He said the administration would fight
   the case “as far as it needs to go,” including up to the
   Supreme Court, and rued that he had been persuaded to sign a
   “watered-down version” of his first travel ban.

   “Let me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the
   first one and go all the way,” Trump said. “The danger is
   clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is
   clear.”

   Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department,
   said in a statement: “The Department of Justice strongly
   disagrees with the federal district court’s ruling, which is
   flawed both in reasoning and in scope. The President’s
   Executive Order falls squarely within his lawful authority in
   seeking to protect our Nation’s security, and the Department
   will continue to defend this Executive Order in the courts.”

   Watson was one of three federal judges to hear arguments
   Wednesday about the ban, though he was the first to issue an
   opinion. Federal judges in Washington state and Maryland said
   they would issue opinions soon.

   As the ruling in Hawaii was being handed down, James L. Robart,
   the federal judge in Washington state who froze Trump’s first
   travel ban, was hearing arguments about whether he should
   freeze the second. He said he did not think his first freeze
   was still in effect, though he did not immediately rule on
   whether he should issue a new one.

   Watson’s decision might not be the last word. He was
   considering only a request for a temporary restraining order,
   and while that required him to assess whether challengers of
   the ban would ultimately succeed, his ruling is not final on
   that question. The Justice Department could appeal the ruling
   or wage a longer-term court battle before the judge in Hawaii.

   Watson’s decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by
   Hawaii. Lawyers for the state alleged that the new entry ban,
   much like the old, violated the establishment clause of the
   First Amendment because it was essentially a Muslim ban, hurt
   the ability of state businesses and universities to recruit top
   talent, and damaged the state’s robust tourism industry.

   They pointed to the case of Ismail Elshikh, the imam of the
   Muslim Association of Hawaii, whose mother-in-law’s application
   for an immigrant visa was still being processed. Under the new
   executive order, attorneys for Hawaii said, Elshikh feared that
   his mother-in-law, a Syrian national, would ultimately be
   banned from entering the United States.

   [[184]Why Hawaii says Trump’s new travel ban is still
   unconstitutional]

    [184] https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/why-hawaii-says-trumps-new-travel-ban-is-still-unconstitutional/2017/03/08/3419306e-040e-11e7-b9fa-ed727b644a0b_story.html?utm_term=.e9143dfa400f

   “Dr. Elshikh certainly has standing in this case. He, along
   with all of the Muslim residents in Hawaii, face higher hurdles
   to see family because of religious faith,” lawyer Colleen Roh
   Sinzdak said at a hearing Wednesday. “It is not merely a harm
   to the Muslim residents of the state of Hawaii, but also is a
   harm to the United States as a whole and is against the First
   Amendment itself.”

   Elshikh is a U.S. citizen of Egyptian descent who has been a
   resident of Hawaii for over a decade. His wife is of Syrian
   descent and is also a resident of Hawaii.

   Justice Department lawyers [185]argued that Trump was well
   within his authority to impose the ban, which was necessary for
   national security, and that those challenging it had raised
   only speculative harms. “They bear the burden of showing
   irreparable harm . . . and there is no harm at all,” said the
   acting U.S. solicitor general, Jeffrey Wall, who argued on
   behalf of the government in Greenbelt, Md., in the morning and
   by phone in Hawaii in the afternoon.

    [185] https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-dept-lays-out-defense-of-revised-travel-ban-as-key-court-hearings-loom/2017/03/13/7ae65764-07fc-11e7-93dc-00f9bdd74ed1_story.html?utm_term=.f52b24b6c189

   Watson agreed with the state on virtually all the points. He
   ruled that the state had preliminarily demonstrated its
   universities and tourism industry would be hurt, and that harm
   could be traced to the executive order. He wrote that Elshikh
   had alleged “direct, concrete injuries to both himself and his
   immediate family.”

   And Watson declared that the government’s assertion of the
   national security need for the order was “at the very least,
   ‘secondary to a religious objective’ of temporarily suspending
   the entry of Muslims.” He pointed to Trump’s own campaign trail
   comments and public statements by advisers as evidence.

   “For instance, there is nothing ‘veiled’ about this press
   release: ‘Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete
   shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,’ ” Watson
   wrote. “Nor is there anything ‘secret’ about the Executive’s
   motive specific to the issuance of the Executive Order. Rudolph
   Giuliani explained on television how the Executive Order came
   to be. He said: ‘When [Mr. Trump] first announced it, he said,
   ‘Muslim ban.’ He called me up. He said, ‘Put a commission
   together. Show me the right way to do it legally.’ ”

   Watson also pointed to a recent Fox News appearance by Stephen
   Miller, in which the president’s senior policy adviser said the
   new ban would have “mostly minor technical differences” from
   the previous iteration frozen by the courts, and Americans
   would see “the same basic policy outcome for the country.”

   “These plainly-worded statements, made in the months leading up
   to and contemporaneous with the signing of the Executive Order,
   and, in many cases, made by the Executive himself, betray the
   Executive Order’s stated secular purpose,” Watson wrote.

   Opponents of the ban across the country — including those who
   had argued against it in different cases on Wednesday — hailed
   Watson’s ruling.

   Bob Ferguson, the Washington state attorney general who asked
   Robart to block the measure, called the Hawaii ruling
   “fantastic news.” Justin Cox, a staff attorney for the National
   Immigration Law Center who argued for a restraining order in
   the case in Maryland, said, “This is absolutely a victory and
   should be celebrated as such, especially because the court held
   that the plaintiffs, that Hawaii was likely to succeed on its
   establishment clause claim which essentially is that the
   primary purpose of the executive order is to discriminate
   against Muslims.”

   Cox said while the judge did not halt the order entirely, he
   blocked the crucial sections — those halting the issuance of
   new visas and suspending the refugee program. Left intact, Cox
   said, were lesser-known provisions, including one that orders
   Homeland Security and the U.S. attorney general to publicize
   information about foreign nationals charged with
   terrorism-related offenses and other crimes. He said the
   provision seems designed to whip up fear of Muslims.

   “It’s a shaming device that it’s really a dehumanizing device,”
   he said. “It perpetuates this myth, this damaging stereotype of
   Muslims as terrorists.”

   Trump’s new entry ban had suspended the U.S. refugee program
   for 120 days and halted for 90 days the issuance of new visas
   to people from six Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Somalia,
   Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Syria. It was different from the first
   entry ban in that it omitted Iraq from the list of affected
   countries, did not affect current visa or green-card holders
   and spelled out a robust list of people who might be able to
   apply for exceptions.

   The administration could have defended the first ban in court —
   though it chose instead to rewrite the president’s executive
   order in such a way that it might be more defensible. The next
   step might have been to persuade the U.S. Court of Appeals for
   the 9th Circuit to rehear the case en banc, after a three-judge
   panel with the court upheld the freeze on Trump’s ban.

   Hawaii is a part of the 9th Circuit, so the legal road could
   pass through the appeals court there again. Perhaps previewing
   the contentious fight ahead, five of the circuit’s judges on
   Wednesday signed a dissenting opinion in the case over the
   original travel ban, declaring Trump’s decision to issue the
   executive order was “well within the powers of the presidency.”
   The judges wanted to wipe out a ruling by a three-judge panel
   declaring otherwise.

   “Above all, in a democracy, we have the duty to preserve the
   liberty of the people by keeping the enormous powers of the
   national government separated,” Judge Jay S. Bybee wrote for
   the dissenters. “We are judges, not Platonic Guardians. It is
   our duty to say what the law is, and the meta-source of our
   law, the U.S. Constitution, commits the power to make foreign
   policy, including the decisions to permit or forbid entry into
   the United States, to the President and Congress.”

   The dissent was signed by Judges Bybee, Sandra S. Ikuta,
   Consuelo M. Callahan and Carlos T. Bea, who all were appointed
   by President George W. Bush; and Judge Alex Kozinski, who was
   appointed by President Ronald Reagan. It seemed to represent a
   minority view. The circuit has 25 active judges, and the court
   said a majority had not voted in favor of reconsidering the
   three-judge panel’s published opinion to keep Trump’s first ban
   frozen.

   That opinion was signed by Judges Michelle T. Friedland, who
   was appointed by President Obama; Richard R. Clifton, who was
   appointed by President George W. Bush; and Judge William C.
   Canby Jr. Judge Stephen Reinhardt formally joined their opinion
   Wednesday and remarked that only a “small number” of 9th
   Circuit judges wanted to overturn it.
