   President Trump discussed his tweeted accusation that President
   Obama ordered "wires" at Trump Tower tapped during last year's
   presidential campaign in an exclusive interview with Fox News'
   "Tucker Carlson Tonight" Wednesday.

   Trump told host Tucker Carlson that the administration "will be
   submitting things" to the House Permanent Select Committee on
   Intelligence "very soon." The president added that he "will be,
   perhaps speaking about this next week" and predicted that
   "you’re going to find some very interesting items coming to the
   forefront over the next 2 weeks."

   When asked by Carlson why he tweeted about the alleged phone
   tap before producing evidence, Trump said his definition of
   wiretapping "covers a lot of different things."

   "That really covers surveillance and many other things. Nobody
   ever talks about the fact that [the words 'wires tapped'] was
   in quotes [in the tweet], but that’s a very important thing."

   Trump defended his ongoing use of social media while in office,
   saying that "maybe I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Twitter,
   because I get such a fake press, such a dishonest press.

   in his presidential victory, his attitude toward the press
   coverage he receives from 'fake new media,'and more #Tucker

   "I'm not including Fox," the president added, "because I think
   Fox has been fair to me ... [but] the news is not honest, much
   of the news. It's not honest, and when I have close to 100
   million people watching me on [social media], I have my own
   form of media."

   When Carlson countered that Trump "devalues his own currency"
   if allegations he makes on Twitter turn out to be untrue, the
   president responded, "Well, let's see whether or not I prove
   it."

   "If I don't do that, I won't get my word out, because when I
   say things, the press doesn't cover it accurately," Trump later
   said. "If they're not going to do me the honor or the public
   the honor of spreading my word accurately ... when I can reach
   that many people, Twitter is a wonderful thing for me, because
   I get the word out."

   When Carlson asked whether any of the president's tweets were
   moderated by his staff, Trump responded, "Sure ... A lot of
   times, my staff comes to me and they say, 'Can you do a tweet
   on this or that because it's not being shown correctly.'"

   Trump also responded sharply to the leak of two pages of his
   2005 tax returns, calling the MSNBC report "a disgrace."

   "I have no idea where they got it but it’s illegal and they’re
   not supposed to have it and it's not supposed to be leaked, and
   it’s certainly not an embarrassing tax return at all, but it’s
   an illegal thing they’ve been doing it, they’ve done it before
   and I think it’s a disgrace," he said.

   The commander-in-chief's comments came afterDCReport.org
   reporter David Cay Johnston revealed 2005 Trump tax documents
   to MSNBC host Rachel Maddow.
