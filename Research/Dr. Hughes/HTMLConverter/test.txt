   [36]North Korea  has long fascinated storytellers, including
   author J. M. Lee. The Boy Who Escaped Paradise, Lee’s latest
   novel translated into English, uses the Hermit Kingdom as the
   backdrop for a tale of defectors, destiny, and hope. A
   labyrinthine book that weaves through Pyongyang’s choreographed
   celebrations to Yanji’s back alleys to Seoul’s refugee
   community, The Boy delivers a haunting journey through the eyes
   of a young man with Asperger syndrome.


   Ahn Gil-mo was 11 when the North Korean school system
   discovered he was a math genius. Because of his talent, he was
   relocated to the capital city with his family and enjoyed a
   life of relative comfort—for a short time. Within a year, his
   family was arrested after his father was discovered to be a
   practicing Christian. Separated from his family in a prison
   camp, Gil-mo befriends a girl, Yong-ae, and ultimately escapes
   the camp to search for her after she is freed.

   Gil-mo’s quest to find Yong-ae takes him from the red light
   districts of border cities to the high-risk-high-reward world
   of Shanghai, where he uses fake passports, assumed names, and
   his math skills to survive. But the law eventually catches up
   with Gil-mo, and he tells his story from FBI custody as a
   suspect for crimes ranging from fraud to murder.

   Jumping back and forth between Gil-mo’s years on the run and
   his interrogation by the FBI makes for a clunky and rushed
   narrative at times, but the novel still offers a fascinating
   story reminiscent of a North Korean Slumdog Millionaire. This,
   of course, isn’t a true-to-life tale, but Lee successfully
   reveals how fortunes can change overnight for society’s most
   vulnerable refugees. Gil-mo ricochets from wealth to poverty
   and comfort to danger numerous times, relying on the kindness
   of others to make ends meet.

   Gil-mo’s Asperger’s adds another layer to the narrative,
   although one that doesn’t feel played out. His fixation on
   finding Yong-ae is endearing and his math abilities save the
   day more than once, but there is a sense of exploitation just
   below the surface. Gil-mo is capable but gullible, willing to
   retreat into numbers whenever given the chance and unable to
   see the people’s possible motives for helping him. This mires
   him in drug rings, fraudulent charity organizations, and other
   schemes that put him in danger.

   Yong-ae herself is more a master manipulator than a damsel in
   distress. Having defected a few months before Gil-mo, she
   strings him along when she needs his help. There’s a sadness to
   their one-sided relationship that tugs at the reader’s
   heartstrings, underscoring how vulnerable Gil-mo truly is as he
   moves through the world by himself.

   Despite a complex framework that doesn’t always do the story
   justice, the novel hits a satisfactory end that feels
   authentic. Lee’s novel touches on the literary need for
   character-driven stories that move beyond the strangeness and
   horror of life under the North Korean state. This, along with
   its thriller-like pace, make The Boy Who Escaped Paradise worth
   a read.
